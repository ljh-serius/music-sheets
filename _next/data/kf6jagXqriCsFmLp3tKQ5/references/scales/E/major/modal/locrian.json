It is often found in more experimental or avant-garde genres such as jazz fusion, progressive rock, and certain types of metal.\n\n## Songs\nHere are three songs that make use of the E Locrian scale:\n1. \"The Dance of Eternity\" by Dream Theater\n2. \"Fracture\" by King Crimson\n3. \"Black Sabbath\" by Black Sabbath\n\nThese songs showcase the unique and distinctive sound that the Locrian mode in E can bring to music compositions."}},"__N_SSG":true}

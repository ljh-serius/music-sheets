The Melodic Minor scale differs from the Natural Minor scale by raising the sixth and seventh notes of the scale when ascending, but is played as the Natural Minor scale when descending. In the key of E, the Melodic Minor scale would be spelled as E, F#, G, A, B, C#, and D# ascending, and D, C, B, A, G, F#, and E descending.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- E (Root)\n- F# (Major 2nd)\n- G (Minor 3rd)\n- A (Perfect 4th)\n- B (Perfect 5th)\n- C# (Major 6th)\n- D# (Major 7th)\n\n## Musical Flavor and Usage\nThe Melodic Minor scale has a unique and somewhat exotic sound due to the raised sixth and seventh notes. This scale is often used in jazz and fusion music to add tension and color to melodies and solos. It can evoke a range of emotions, from mysterious and tense to ethereal and otherworldly. The raised seventh note is a defining characteristic that sets the Melodic Minor scale apart from other scales.\n\n## Songs\nHere are three songs that prominently feature the Melodic Minor scale:\n1. \"So What\" by Miles Davis\n2. \"Spain\" by Chick Corea\n3. \"Impressions\" by John Coltrane"}},"__N_SSG":true}

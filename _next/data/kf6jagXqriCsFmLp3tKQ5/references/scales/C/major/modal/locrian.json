In this case, the Major scale in the key of C starts on the 7th degree which is B, creating the B Locrian mode. The B Locrian mode has the same notes as the C Major scale but starting and ending on the B note.\n\n#### Notes:\n- B, C, D, E, F, G, A\n\n#### Intervals:\n- Root (B) - Minor 2nd (C) - Minor 3rd (D) - Perfect 4th (E) - Diminished 5th (F) - Minor 6th (G) - Minor 7th (A)\n\n#### Musical Flavor:\nThe Locrian mode has a dissonant sound due to the diminished 5th interval, known as the tritone. It often evokes suspense and unease in musical compositions. The minor 2nd interval also contributes to the tense quality of this mode.\n\n#### Genre:\nThe Locrian mode is rarely used in popular music due to its dissonant and unresolved sound. It is more commonly found in experimental or avant-garde music where composers explore unconventional harmonies and textures.\n\n#### Example Songs:\n1. \"Fracture\" by King Crimson\n2. \"Havona\" by Weather Report\n3. \"Caravan\" by John Wasson"}},"__N_SSG":true}

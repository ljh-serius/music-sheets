It consists of seven notes, each a whole step (2 frets) apart except for the 3rd and 4th, and the 7th and 1st notes which are half steps (1 fret) apart. This scale is commonly used in various genres of music, adding different flavors and tonalities to the compositions.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- G (Root)\n- A (Whole step from G)\n- Bb (Half step from A)\n- C (Whole step from Bb)\n- D (Whole step from C)\n- Eb (Half step from D)\n- F (Whole step from Eb)\n- G (Octave)\n\nIntervals:\n- Root (G) - Whole Step (W) - 2 frets\n- 2nd (A) - Whole Step (W) - 2 frets\n- minor 3rd (Bb) - Half Step (H) - 1 fret\n- 4th (C) - Whole Step (W) - 2 frets\n- 5th (D) - Whole Step (W) - 2 frets\n- minor 6th (Eb) - Half Step (H) - 1 fret\n- minor 7th (F) - Whole Step (W) - 2 frets\n- Octave (G)\n\n## Genre and Flavor\nThe Major scale in G with a Locrian mode shape gives a unique and somewhat dissonant sound, due to the diminished fifth between the 1st and 5th degree (G and D). This scale is often used in jazz, metal, fusion, and experimental music. It adds tension and a mysterious, unresolved quality to the music, creating an intriguing and sometimes dark atmosphere.\n\n## Songs\nHere are three songs that utilize the Major scale in G with a Locrian mode shape:\n1. \"Black Sabbath\" by Black Sabbath - This iconic metal song features riffs and solos based on the Locrian mode, creating a heavy and ominous sound.\n2. \"So What\" by Miles Davis - A jazz classic that uses the Locrian mode extensively, showcasing the unique tonality and color of the scale.\n3. \"YYZ\" by Rush - This progressive rock instrumental showcases complex guitar solos and basslines in the Locrian mode, adding a fusion of jazz and rock elements to the music."}},"__N_SSG":true}

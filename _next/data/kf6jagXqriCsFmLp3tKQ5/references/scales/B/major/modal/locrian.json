When this Major scale is played from the seventh scale degree to the next B an octave higher, it creates the Locrian mode, which gives it a unique sound and flavor.\n\n### Notes and Intervals:\nThe B Major scale consists of the following notes:\n- B (Root)\n- C#\n- D#\n- E\n- F#\n- G#\n- A#\n\nThe intervals in the B Major scale are:\n- Root (B)\n- Major 2nd (C#)\n- Major 3rd (D#)\n- Perfect 4th (E)\n- Perfect 5th (F#)\n- Major 6th (G#)\n- Major 7th (A#)\n\n### Genre and Musical Flavor:\nThe Major scale in B, specifically in the Locrian mode, has a dissonant and unresolved quality due to its diminished fifth interval between the root note and the fifth note of the scale. This unique sound makes it a less common choice in popular music genres but is often used in jazz, avant-garde, and experimental music where musicians seek to explore more dissonant and unstable harmonic qualities.\n\n### Songs:\nHere are three songs that utilize the Major scale in B (Locrian mode) in their compositions:\n1. **\"Satch Boogie\" by Joe Satriani**: This instrumental rock song features sections that use the Locrian mode, adding a sense of tension and uniqueness to the guitar solos.\n2. **\"Lonely Boy\" by Andrew Gold**: While primarily based on the natural minor scale, sections of this soft rock song incorporate the Locrian mode to introduce an unexpected twist to the harmonic progression.\n3. **\"Song X\" by Pat Metheny and Ornette Coleman**: This avant-garde jazz composition blends different scales and modes, including the Locrian mode, to create a complex and dissonant musical landscape.\n\nBy understanding the Major scale in B and its Locrian mode, musicians can experiment with its distinct intervals and use it to add an intriguing and unconventional touch to their musical compositions."}},"__N_SSG":true}

In the key of D, the major scale consists of the notes D, E, F#, G#, A, B, and C#. When played in the Lydian mode with Shape A, the 4th degree of the scale is raised by a half step compared to the standard major scale, resulting in an augmented 4th interval. This alteration gives the Lydian mode a distinctive and somewhat dreamy sound.\n\n## Intervals \n- Root (D)\n- Major 2nd (E)\n- Major 3rd (F#)\n- Augmented 4th (G#)\n- Perfect 5th (A)\n- Major 6th (B)\n- Major 7th (C#)\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe Lydian mode, with its raised 4th degree, has a bright and somewhat ethereal quality.

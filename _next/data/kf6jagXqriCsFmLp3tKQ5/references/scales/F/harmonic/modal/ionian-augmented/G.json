This scale is derived from the F major scale but with a raised 5th degree. It consists of the following notes: F, G, A, B, C#, D, E. The intervallic structure of this scale is as follows:\n- Root (F)\n- Major 2nd (G)\n- Major 3rd (A)\n- Perfect 4th (B)\n- Augmented 5th (C#)\n- Major 6th (D)\n- Major 7th (E)\n\nThis scale has a distinct and exotic sound due to the augmented 5th, which sets it apart from traditional major scales. The augmented 5th creates tension and adds a sense of mystery to melodies played using this scale. It is often associated with genres like jazz fusion, world music, and experimental music due to its colorful and adventurous nature.\n\n### Songs using Harmonic in F:\n1. **\"Caravan\" by Duke Ellington** - This jazz standard features sections that utilize the harmonic scale, particularly in the solos where musicians explore the scale's unique intervals.\n   \n2. **\"Mediterranean Sundance\" by Al Di Meola** - This instrumental track blends elements of jazz, flamenco, and rock, with Al Di Meola showcasing his virtuosity on the guitar using the Harmonic in F scale.\n   \n3. **\"Meeting by the River\" by Ry Cooder and Vishwa Mohan Bhatt** - In this collaborative piece, the Harmonic in F scale is used to create a meditative and flowing musical landscape, blending elements of blues and Indian classical music."}},"__N_SSG":true}

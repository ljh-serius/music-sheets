It has a distinct flavor due to its flattened second scale degree compared to the regular Lydian mode. This scale is often used to create tension and interest in compositions and improvisations, as the altered second note adds a unique color to the overall sound.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- A# (root)\n- B# (major second)\n- C## (augmented third)\n- D# (perfect fourth)\n- E# (augmented fifth)\n- F## (major sixth)\n- G# (major seventh)\n\n## Musical Flavor and Usage\nThe Harmonic scale in A# (Lydian #2) has a dreamy and exotic sound. It can be used in jazz, fusion, and progressive music to add a sense of unpredictability and exoticism to the harmonic structure. The flattened second note creates a dissonant interval that can be resolved in various ways, adding tension and color to the music.\n\n## Example Songs\n1. \"Lydian Dreams\" by Jazz Fusion Ensemble\n2. \"Beyond The Ordinary\" by Progressive Rock Band X\n3. \"Eastward Bound\" by Contemporary Jazz Artist Y"}},"__N_SSG":true}

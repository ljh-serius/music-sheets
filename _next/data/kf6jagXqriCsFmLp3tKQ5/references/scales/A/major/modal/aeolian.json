When the Major scale is played from the sixth degree, it takes on a different flavor and is known as the Aeolian mode. In this reference, we will look at the A Major scale in the Aeolian mode. \n\n## Notes and Intervals\n\n- A (Root)\n- B (Major 2nd)\n- C (Minor 3rd)\n- D (Perfect 4th)\n- E (Perfect 5th)\n- F (Minor 6th)\n- G (Minor 7th)\n- A (Octave)\n\nThe A Major scale in the Aeolian mode consists of the same notes as the F# Natural Minor scale but starting and ending on A, giving it a different tonal center.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\n\nThe Aeolian mode, especially from the perspective of A Major, is often associated with a somber and melancholic feel due to the intervals between the notes. The minor 3rd and minor 6th intervals create a sense of tension and depth, making it suitable for conveying emotions such as sadness or introspection. This scale is commonly used in various genres such as rock, metal, blues, and jazz for creating introspective melodies and emotional moods.\n\n## Songs\n\n1. *Comfortably Numb* by Pink Floyd - The guitar solos in this song, especially David Gilmour's iconic outro solo, heavily use the A Major scale in the Aeolian mode to evoke a feeling of numbness and melancholy.\n   \n2. *All Along the Watchtower* by Jimi Hendrix - In this classic rock song, the guitar solo showcases the A Major scale in the Aeolian mode, adding a sense of mystery and intensity to the music.\n\n3. *Black Magic Woman* by Santana - Santana's guitar work in this song often incorporates the A Major scale in the Aeolian mode, contributing to the song's mystical and hypnotic vibe."}},"__N_SSG":true}

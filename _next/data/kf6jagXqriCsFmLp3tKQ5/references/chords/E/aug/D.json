In this case, we are looking at an E augmented chord with the shape of a D chord. This means that when you play a D chord shape on the guitar and move it up two frets (whole steps), you get an E augmented chord.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- **E** (Root)\n- **G#** (Major Third)\n- **C** (Augmented Fifth)\n\n## Musical Flavor and Genre\nThe augmented chord is known for its dissonant and unsettled sound. It creates tension and does not provide a clear sense of resolution. Augmented chords are often used to add color and tension in music compositions, and they are commonly found in jazz, classical, and experimental genres.\n\n## Songs\n1. **The Beatles - \"Because\"**: This song features an E augmented chord in the vocal harmonies during the bridge section, adding a dreamy and mysterious quality to the music.\n   \n2. **Radiohead - \"Paranoid Android\"**: The guitar part in the chorus of this song includes an E augmented chord, contributing to the intense and dissonant atmosphere of the track.\n\n3. **Led Zeppelin - \"Heartbreaker\"**: In the iconic guitar riff of this song, an E augmented chord is used to create a sense of tension and excitement before resolving back to the main riff."}},"__N_SSG":true}

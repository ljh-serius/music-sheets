In the key of C, with a D shape, it consists of the notes C, E, and G#. The augmented chord has a unique sound due to the augmented fifth (C-G#), which creates a dissonant and unstable quality often used for tension and resolution in music.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- **Root**: C\n- **Major Third**: E\n- **Augmented Fifth**: G#\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe augmented chord is often used in jazz, classical, and experimental music due to its dissonant and unresolved nature. It adds a sense of tension and unease to a musical piece, which can be resolved by moving to a different chord or resolving back to the tonic. The augmented chord has a mysterious and ethereal quality that can create a sense of suspense and intrigue in a composition.\n\n## Songs\nHere are three songs that prominently feature the augmented chord in their composition:\n1. \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" by The Beatles\n2. \"Purple Haze\" by Jimi Hendrix\n3. \"Pure Imagination\" from the movie \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\""}},"__N_SSG":true}

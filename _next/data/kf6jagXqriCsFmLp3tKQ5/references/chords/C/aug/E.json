In the key of C major with the E shape, the augmented chord is built off the note C. In this shape, the notes in the chord are C (root), E# (major third), and G## (augmented fifth).\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- **Root**: C\n- **Major Third**: E# (enhanced or sharp E)\n- **Augmented Fifth**: G## (double sharp G)\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe Augmented chord is often used to create tension and dissonance in music. It has a unique and distinctive sound due to the augmented fifth, which is an enharmonic equivalent of a minor sixth. This chord is commonly used in jazz, classical, and experimental music to add color and texture. When used in compositions, the Augmented chord can evoke a sense of mystery, unpredictability, and unease.\n\n## Songs\nHere are three songs that use the Augmented chord:\n1. **The Beatles - \"Because\"**: This song features an Augmented chord in the vocal harmonies during the chorus.\n2. **Miles Davis - \"So What\"**: The improvised solos in this jazz classic often incorporate Augmented chords for a more abstract and avant-garde sound.\n3. **Igor Stravinsky - \"The Rite of Spring\"**: This iconic classical piece showcases the Augmented chord in its dissonant and unconventional harmonies."}},"__N_SSG":true}

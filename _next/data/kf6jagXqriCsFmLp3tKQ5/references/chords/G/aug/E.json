It is created by raising the fifth of a major chord by a half step. In the key of G, applying the augmented chord shape based on the E shape results in a G augmented chord.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n\n- **Root**: G\n- **Major 3rd**: B\n- **Augmented 5th**: D#\n\nThe notes in a G augmented chord are G, B, and D#. The intervals between these notes are a major 3rd (4 half steps) from G to B, and an augmented 5th (8 half steps) from G to D#.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\n\nThe augmented chord is often used to create tension and add color to a progression. It is commonly found in jazz, classical, and avant-garde music due to its dissonant and unresolved nature. In jazz, the augmented chord is frequently used as a passing chord or to add movement and interest to a chord progression.\n\nThe G augmented chord, specifically in the context of the E shape, can provide a mysterious and tense atmosphere to a piece of music. It has a distinct and almost unsettling quality that can evoke a sense of anticipation or uncertainty.\n\n## Songs\n\nThree songs that feature the G augmented chord or its variations:\n\n1. **The Beatles - \"Because\"**: This song from the album \"Abbey Road\" features an augmented chord progression that contributes to its ethereal and dreamy sound.\n   \n2. **Duke Ellington - \"Caravan\"**: In this jazz standard, the augmented chord is used to create tension and intensity in the composition.\n   \n3. **Radiohead - \"Paranoid Android\"**: Radiohead's experimental approach incorporates augmented chords in this song, adding to its complex and unpredictable musical landscape.\n\nRemember to experiment with the G augmented chord in different contexts to explore its unique sound and musical possibilities."}},"__N_SSG":true}

In this specific case, the arpeggio is an add4 chord in the key of E with a guitar shape based on a C major chord. This creates an interesting and unique sound that can be used to add color and flavor to a musical piece.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- **E (Root)**\n- **G (Minor 3rd)**\n- **B (5th)**\n- **F# (Major 7th)**\n- **C (Major 3rd)**\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThis arpeggio adds a jazzy and sophisticated flavor to music due to the inclusion of the major 7th (F#) interval.

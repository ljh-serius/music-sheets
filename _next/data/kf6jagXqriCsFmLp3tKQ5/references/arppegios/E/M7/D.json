In this specific case, we are focusing on a Major 7th arpeggio in the key of E. The shape of this arpeggio is based on the D shape in this particular position on the fretboard.\n\n---\n\n## Notes and Intervals:\n\nThe notes of a Major 7th chord consist of the root (E), major 3rd (G#), perfect 5th (B), and major 7th (D#) of the E major scale. When played in arpeggio form, these notes are played in sequence, highlighting the unique harmonies of the Major 7th chord.\n\n---\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor:\n\nThe Major 7th arpeggio in E is commonly used in genres like jazz, fusion, and some forms of rock music. It provides a smooth, sophisticated, and colorful sound due to the inclusion of the Major 7th interval, which adds a sense of tension and resolution to the overall harmonic texture.

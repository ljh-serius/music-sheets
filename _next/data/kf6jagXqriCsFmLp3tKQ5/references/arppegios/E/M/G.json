In the case of a Major arpeggio in the key of E, this would involve playing the notes E, G#, and B in a sequential pattern. The specific shape mentioned as \"G\" typically refers to a guitar finger positioning that represents this arpeggio on the fretboard.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- E (Root)\n- G# (Major 3rd)\n- B (Perfect 5th)\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nArpeggios are commonly used in various genres of music, including classical, rock, jazz, and pop. Major arpeggios, such as the one in E major, have a bright and uplifting sound due to the major 3rd interval.

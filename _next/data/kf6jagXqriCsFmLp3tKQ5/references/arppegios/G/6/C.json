In this case, the arpeggio is built on the 6th degree of the G major scale, using the \"C shape\" to form the arpeggio.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n\nThe G major scale consists of the notes G, A, B, C, D, E, and F#. When building an arpeggio on the 6th degree, which is E in this case, the notes of the arpeggio would be E, G, B, and D. These notes create a minor 7th arpeggio, as the intervals between the notes are root (E), minor 3rd (G), perfect 5th (B), and minor 7th (D).\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\n\nArpeggios are commonly used in various genres of music to create melodic interest and rhythmic movement. In this context, the 6th arpeggio in G (using the C shape) provides a melancholic and introspective flavor to the music. It is often used in jazz, fusion, and progressive rock genres to add complexity and color to chord progressions.\n\n## Songs\n\nThree songs that showcase the use of the 6th arpeggio in G (C shape) are:\n\n1. **\"Breezin'\" by George Benson**: This jazz-funk classic features smooth guitar arpeggios that demonstrate the subtle beauty of the 6th arpeggio in G.\n   \n2. **\"Europa\" by Santana**: The haunting melody of this instrumental piece by Santana incorporates arpeggios that highlight the emotional depth of the 6th arpeggio in G.\n   \n3. **\"The Dance of Eternity\" by Dream Theater**: Known for their complex compositions, Dream Theater uses intricate arpeggios, including the 6th arpeggio in G, to showcase technical prowess and progressive flair in this instrumental track."}},"__N_SSG":true}

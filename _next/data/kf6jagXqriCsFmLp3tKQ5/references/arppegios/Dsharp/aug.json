The augmented arpeggio consists of the root note, a major third above, and an augmented fifth above the root note.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n\nIn a D# augmented arpeggio, the notes included would be:\n\n- D# (root note)\n- G (major third)\n- A## (augmented fifth)\n\nThe intervals between these notes would be a major third between D# and G, and an augmented fifth between G and A#.\n\n## Genre and Flavor\n\nThe augmented arpeggio can often be found in genres such as jazz, classical, and progressive rock. It adds a sense of tension and dissonance to the music due to the augmented fifth interval, creating a unique and vibrant sound.\n\n## Songs\n\nThree songs that feature the D# augmented arpeggio are:\n\n1. \"Scar Tissue\" by Red Hot Chili Peppers - The song includes an augmented arpeggio in the guitar riff during the chorus.\n  \n2. \"Eclipse\" by Pink Floyd - The augmented arpeggio is used in the guitar solo, adding an eerie and otherworldly flavor to the music.\n  \n3. \"Symphony No. 4\" by Gustav Mahler - This classical piece features augmented arpeggios in the strings section, showcasing the versatility of this musical element."}},"__N_SSG":true}

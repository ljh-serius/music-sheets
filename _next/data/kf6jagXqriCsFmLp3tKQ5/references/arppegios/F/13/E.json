In this case, the 13th arpeggio in the key of F using the shape of the E chord creates a rich and vibrant sound.\n\n## Notes and Intervals:\n- F (Root)\n- A (3rd)\n- C (5th)\n- E (7th)\n- G (9th)\n- Bb (11th)\n- D (13th)\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor:\nThis arpeggio lends itself well to genres such as jazz, fusion, and R&B due to its complex and colorful nature. The addition of the 13th to the chord creates a sense of sophistication and tension that can add depth and interest to musical compositions.\n\n## Songs:\n1. **\"So What\" by Miles Davis**\n   - This iconic jazz tune features modal playing and uses the 13th arpeggio in F to create a modal sound.\n   \n2. **\"Spain\" by Chick Corea**\n   - This fusion jazz piece incorporates complex harmonies and uses arpeggios to create rhythmic interest throughout the song.\n   \n3. **\"Doo Wop (That Thing)\" by Lauryn Hill**\n   - An R&B track that features soulful vocals and uses arpeggios to enhance the harmonic structure of the song."}},"__N_SSG":true}

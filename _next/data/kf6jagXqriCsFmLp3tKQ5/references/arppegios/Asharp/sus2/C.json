The sus2 arpeggio features the root note, the major second, and the perfect fifth of the corresponding chord, giving it a dreamy and unresolved sound due to the absence of the major or minor third.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- Root (A#)\n- Major Second (C)\n- Perfect Fifth (F)\n\n## Musical Flavor\nThe sus2 arpeggio, when played in the key of A#, has a mysterious and ethereal quality. It lacks the typical major or minor tonality, creating a unique and unresolved tension that can add depth and emotion to a musical piece.\n\n## Genre and Usage\nThe sus2 arpeggio is commonly used in genres such as ambient, dream pop, and experimental music. It is often employed to create a sense of ambiguity and floaty texture in a composition, leading to a more introspective and atmospheric mood.\n\n## Songs\n1. **\"To Build a Home\" by The Cinematic Orchestra**: This song features delicate piano arpeggios with sus2 chords that enhance the emotional depth of the track.\n  \n2. **\"Bloom\" by Radiohead**: In this song, Radiohead uses sus2 arpeggios on guitar to create a haunting and otherworldly sonic landscape.\n  \n3. **\"Aqueous Transmission\" by Incubus**: The ending section of this song showcases the sus2 arpeggio played on a pipa (a Chinese string instrument), adding a tranquil and meditative quality to the music."}},"__N_SSG":true}

When an arpeggio includes the 11th note of the scale, it adds a unique flavor to the chord progression.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\nIn the key of F#, the 11th note corresponds to the note B#. When played in arpeggio form in the shape of E major, the arpeggio would consist of the following notes: E (root), G# (3rd), B (5th), D# (7th), and B# (11th). This combination of notes creates an ethereal sound that can add depth and complexity to a musical piece.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nArpeggios featuring the 11th in F# are often used in genres like jazz, fusion, and progressive rock.

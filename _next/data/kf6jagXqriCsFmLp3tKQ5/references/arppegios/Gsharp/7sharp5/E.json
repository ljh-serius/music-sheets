The Dominant 7#5 arpeggio consists of the root (G#), major third (B#), augmented fifth (Dx), and minor seventh (F#) of a dominant 7#5 chord in G#. When utilizing the E shape on the guitar, this arpeggio provides a unique and dissonant sound that can add tension and color to your music.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- G# (Root)\n- B# (Major Third)\n- Dx (Augmented Fifth)\n- F# (Minor Seventh)\n\n| Note | Interval from Root |\n|------|--------------------|\n| G#   | Root               |\n| B#   | Major Third        |\n| Dx   | Augmented Fifth    |\n| F#   | Minor Seventh      |\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe Dominant 7#5 arpeggio, with its augmented fifth, adds a sense of tension and dissonance to the music.

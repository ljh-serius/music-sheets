In this case, the arpeggio is a Minor 7th in the key of G# using the E shape.\n\n## Notes and Intervals:\n- G# (Root)\n- B (Minor 3rd)\n- D# (5th)\n- F# (Minor 7th)\n\nThe intervals in a Minor 7th arpeggio consist of a root, minor 3rd, 5th, and minor 7th, creating a smooth and slightly melancholic sound.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor:\nMinor 7th arpeggios are commonly used in jazz, R&B, funk, and soul music. The use of the minor 7th gives a mellow and sophisticated vibe to the music, adding depth and emotion to chord progressions and solos.\n\n## Example Songs:\n1. **\"Fly Me to the Moon\" by Frank Sinatra** - This classic jazz standard features Minor 7th arpeggios in the chord progressions and melody.\n   \n2. **\"Isn't She Lovely\" by Stevie Wonder** - In this soul and R&B hit, Minor 7th arpeggios are used to create the smooth and groovy sound of the song.\n\n3. **\"So What\" by Miles Davis** - A modal jazz piece that extensively uses Minor 7th arpeggios to establish the modal sound and improvisational framework of the song."}},"__N_SSG":true}

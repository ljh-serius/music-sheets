The \"add4\" arpeggio includes the root note, third, fifth, and an added fourth note of the scale.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\nFor the G# add4 arpeggio, the notes used are G# (root), B# (3rd), D# (5th), and C# (added 4th). The intervals within the arpeggio are minor 3rd (G# to B#), minor 3rd (B# to D#), and major 2nd (D# to C#).\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThis arpeggio can add a sense of tension and color to a piece of music due to the dissonant interval created by the added fourth note. It is commonly used in genres like progressive metal, jazz fusion, and neoclassical music to create a sense of complexity and intrigue.\n\n## Songs\nHere are three songs that feature the G# add4 arpeggio:\n\n1. **Dream Theater - \"The Dance of Eternity\"**: This progressive metal masterpiece by Dream Theater showcases technical prowess with intricate arpeggios, including the add4 arpeggio in various sections of the song.\n\n2. **Allan Holdsworth - \"White Line\"**: Jazz fusion virtuoso Allan Holdsworth incorporates the G# add4 arpeggio in his compositions, blending complex harmonic structures with fluid improvisation.\n\n3. **Yngwie Malmsteen - \"Far Beyond the Sun\"**: Neoclassical guitar legend Yngwie Malmsteen often utilizes arpeggios in his shredding solos, and the G# add4 arpeggio can be heard in this iconic instrumental track."}},"__N_SSG":true}

An augmented chord is made up of a root note, a major third, and an augmented fifth. In the key of D, an augmented arpeggio would consist of the notes D, F#, and A#. This creates a unique and somewhat dissonant sound that can add tension and drama to a piece of music.\n\n### **Notes and Intervals:**\n- **D (Root)**\n- **F# (Major Third)**\n- **A# (Augmented Fifth)**\n\n### **Genre and Musical Flavor:**\nAugmented arpeggios are often used in genres that require a sense of mystery or tension, such as jazz, classical, and progressive rock.

An augmented arpeggio is made up of the 1st, 3rd, and #5th notes of the major scale. In the key of C major, the C augmented arpeggio would include the notes C, E, and G#. \n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- C (1st)\n- E (3rd)\n- G# (#5th)\n\nThis arpeggio creates a tense and dissonant sound due to the augmented 5th interval between the C and G# notes. It is commonly used in jazz, classical, and fusion music to add color and tension to a progression.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe augmented arpeggio is often used in genres such as jazz, classical, and fusion due to its unique and dissonant sound.

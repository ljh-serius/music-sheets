In this case, we are looking at the Dominant 7th arpeggio in the key of C.\n\n### Notes and Intervals\n\nThe Dominant 7th arpeggio in C consists of the following notes and intervals:\n- C (Root)\n- E (Major 3rd)\n- G (Perfect 5th)\n- Bb (Dominant 7th)\n\nThe sequence would be C-E-G-Bb-C, and this forms the distinct sound of a Dominant 7th chord when played melodically.\n\n### Musical Flavor and Usage\n\nThe Dominant 7th chord is a fundamental chord in music theory, often used to create tension that resolves to the tonic (C in this case). This arpeggio has a very distinct, slightly dissonant sound due to the interval between the dominant 7th and the tonic.\n\nIt is commonly found in genres like jazz, blues, funk, and rock music, where its sound adds color and movement to chord progressions. The Dominant 7th arpeggio is frequently used to create tension before resolving to a consonant chord.\n\n### Songs\n\nHere are three songs that prominently feature the Dominant 7th arpeggio in C:\n1. **\"Sweet Home Chicago\" by Robert Johnson** - This blues classic uses the Dominant 7th arpeggio in the iconic turnaround progression.\n2. **\"So What\" by Miles Davis** - This jazz standard features the Dominant 7th arpeggio within its sophisticated chord progression.\n3. **\"Purple Haze\" by Jimi Hendrix** - This rock anthem incorporates the Dominant 7th arpeggio in its riff, adding a bluesy flavor to the song.\n\nThese songs showcase how the Dominant 7th arpeggio is used across different genres to create unique and engaging musical experiences."}},"__N_SSG":true}

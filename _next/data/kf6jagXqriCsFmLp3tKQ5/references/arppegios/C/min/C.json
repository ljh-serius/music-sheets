In a Minor arpeggio in the key of C, the notes played would be C, E♭, and G. This creates a melancholic and moody sound characteristic of the Minor key.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- **C** (Root note)\n- **E♭** (Minor third above C)\n- **G** (Perfect fifth above C)\n\n## Genre and Flavor\nThe Minor arpeggio in C is commonly used in various genres such as Classical, Jazz, Blues, and Rock to evoke intense emotions like sadness, longing, and introspection. The melancholic flavor of the Minor key can add depth and complexity to a musical piece, giving it a more somber or dramatic feel compared to Major arpeggios.\n\n## Examples in Songs\n1. **\"Stairway to Heaven\" by Led Zeppelin**: The iconic guitar arpeggio intro to this classic rock song features a Minor arpeggio in C that sets a haunting and mystical tone.\n2. **\"Moonlight Sonata\" by Ludwig van Beethoven**: This famous piano composition prominently incorporates Minor arpeggios in C throughout, creating a somber and introspective atmosphere.\n3. **\"All Blues\" by Miles Davis**: In this jazz standard, musicians often improvise using Minor arpeggios in C to enhance the bluesy and emotive quality of the piece."}},"__N_SSG":true}

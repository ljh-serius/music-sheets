In this case, we are focusing on the 9th arpeggio in the key of C using the G shape. The 9th arpeggio adds the 9th note of the C major scale to the standard C major chord, creating a richer and more complex sound.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n\nThe 9th arpeggio in C using the G shape consists of the following notes in the key of C major:\n- C (root)\n- E (major 3rd)\n- G (perfect 5th)\n- B (major 7th)\n- D (9th)\n\nThe intervals between these notes are as follows:\n- Root to major 3rd (C to E) - Major 3rd\n- Major 3rd to perfect 5th (E to G) - Perfect 5th\n- Perfect 5th to major 7th (G to B) - Major 7th\n- Major 7th to 9th (B to D) - Major 2nd or 9th\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\n\nThe 9th arpeggio used in the G shape is often found in genres like jazz, fusion, and R&B. It adds a sophisticated and jazzy flavor to the music due to the inclusion of the 9th interval, which creates tension and interest in the chord progression.\n\n## Songs\n\nHere are three songs that use the 9th arpeggio in C (Shape: G) prominently:\n1. \"*So What*\" by Miles Davis\n2. \"*Chameleon*\" by Herbie Hancock\n3. \"*Isn't She Lovely*\" by Stevie Wonder\n\nThese songs showcase the use of the 9th arpeggio in different musical contexts, highlighting its versatility and appeal in various genres."}},"__N_SSG":true}

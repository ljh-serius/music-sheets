The 11th arpeggio in C is based on the C major chord, but it includes the 11th note in the C major scale (which is F). In the C major scale, the notes are: C (1), D (2), E (3), F (4), G (5), A (6), B (7), and the 11th note repeats the pattern starting from C again.\n\n### Notes and Intervals:\n- C (Root)\n- E (3rd)\n- G (5th)\n- B (7th)\n- D (9th)\n- F (11th)\n\n### Genres and Flavor:\nThe 11th arpeggio in C is commonly used in jazz, fusion, and funk music. It adds a jazzy and colorful flavor to the music due to the inclusion of the 11th note, which extends the chord beyond the basic triad. This arpeggio is often used in more complex and harmonically rich compositions to create a sophisticated and modern sound.\n\n### Songs:\n1. **\"Spain\" by Chick Corea** - This jazz fusion classic features variations of the 11th arpeggio in C throughout the song, showcasing its versatility and melodic potential.\n  \n2. **\"Cissy Strut\" by The Meters** - In this funk instrumental, you can hear the 11th arpeggio in C being used in a rhythmic and groovy context, adding depth to the chord progressions.\n  \n3. **\"So What\" by Miles Davis** - The 11th arpeggio in C is subtly integrated into the modal jazz composition, enriching the harmonic palette and providing a unique texture to the music."}},"__N_SSG":true}

In this case, we are looking at the Diminished arpeggio in the key of B, played in the shape of A on the guitar. \n\n### Notes and Intervals:\n\nThe B Diminished arpeggio typically consists of the notes B, D, and F. When played in the A shape on the guitar, it creates a unique and tense sound, due to the intervals involved. The intervals in a Diminished arpeggio are minor third intervals (3 semitones) between the root and the second note, and between the second note and the diminished fifth.\n\n### Genre and Musical Flavor:\n\nDiminished arpeggios are often used in Jazz, Classical, and Metal music due to their dissonant and chromatic nature. In Jazz, they can add tension and a sense of suspense to a musical passage. In Classical music, they are used to create a sense of dissonance and unease. In Metal, Diminished arpeggios can add a dark and aggressive flavor to the music.\n\n### Songs:\n\n1. **\"Don't Know Why\" by Norah Jones**: This Jazz-pop song features tasteful arpeggios that include Diminished arpeggios, adding a touch of sophistication to the music.\n  \n2. **\"Black Star\" by Yngwie Malmsteen**: This instrumental track by the legendary guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen showcases his virtuosity with intense arpeggios, including Diminished shapes, in a neoclassical metal setting.\n\n3. **\"In the Hall of the Mountain King\" by Edvard Grieg**: This classical piece prominently features Diminished arpeggios, creating a sense of urgency and tension in the music as it builds towards its climax."}},"__N_SSG":true}

In this case, we are looking at the suspended 4th (sus4) arpeggio in the key of B major using the C shape on the guitar.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- **B** - Root note\n- **E** - 4th note in the B major scale\n- **F#** - 5th note in the B major scale\n- **C#** - Major 2nd relative to B note\n- **G#** - Major 6th relative to B note\n\n## Musical Flavor and Genre\nThe sus4 arpeggio adds tension and a unique flavor to the music. It creates a sense of anticipation and movement due to the suspension of the 3rd note of the chord. This arpeggio is often used in rock, pop, and jazz music to add color and interest to chord progressions.\n\n## Songs\nHere are three songs that feature the sus4 arpeggio in the key of B:\n\n1. **\"Stairway to Heaven\" by Led Zeppelin** - The iconic intro features a sus4 arpeggio in the key of B that sets the mood for the song.\n   \n2. **\"Message in a Bottle\" by The Police** - This song utilizes sus4 arpeggios in various parts of the guitar riff to create a melodic and rhythmic pattern.\n\n3. **\"Under the Bridge\" by Red Hot Chili Peppers** - The intro riff of this song includes a sus4 arpeggio in the key of B, adding a melodic and atmospheric element to the music."}},"__N_SSG":true}

The arpeggio consists of the notes G, B, and D# and creates a distinct and unique sound due to the augmented interval between the root note and the third.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- G (root note)\n- B (major third)\n- D# (augmented fifth)\n\nThe intervals in this arpeggio are a major third between G and B, and an augmented fifth between G and D#. This combination of intervals gives the arpeggio its augmented quality and creates a sense of tension and dissonance in the sound.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe augmented arpeggio in G with the shape of C is often used in genres like jazz, classical, and progressive rock.

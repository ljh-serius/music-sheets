In a major arpeggio, the notes used are the root (1), the major third (3), and the perfect fifth (5) of the corresponding major chord. When played in the key of G with the D shape on the guitar, the arpeggio notes would be G (1), B (3), and D (5).\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n\n- **G (1)**: The root note of the arpeggio, giving it a stable and resolved sound.\n- **B (3)**: The major third, creating a sense of brightness and happiness in the arpeggio.\n- **D (5)**: The perfect fifth, offering a strong harmonic support to the overall sound.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\n\nMajor arpeggios are commonly used in various genres of music such as pop, rock, country, and classical.

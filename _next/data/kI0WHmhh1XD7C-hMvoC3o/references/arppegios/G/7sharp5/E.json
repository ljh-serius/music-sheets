When played in the \"E shape\" position, it is commonly used in jazz, fusion, and other complex genres to add tension and color to chord progressions.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- G (Root)\n- B (Major Third)\n- D# (Augmented Fifth)\n- F (Minor Seventh)\n\n## Musical Flavor\nThis arpeggio has a unique and tense sound due to the augmented fifth (D#), which creates dissonance when played against standard major or dominant chords. The combination of the major third (B) and minor seventh (F) adds complexity and richness to the overall sound. It is often used in situations where a sense of tension or unresolved motion is desired.\n\n## Songs\nHere are three songs that feature the Dominant 7#5 arpeggio in G:\n\n1. **\"Spain\" by Chick Corea** - This iconic jazz fusion piece showcases the use of various arpeggios, including the Dominant 7#5, to create harmonic interest and movement.\n   \n2. **\"Giant Steps\" by John Coltrane** - In this legendary jazz composition, the Dominant 7#5 arpeggio is commonly used in improvisational sections to navigate the complex chord changes.\n   \n3. **\"The Fusion Jam\" by Allan Holdsworth** - Holdsworth was known for his innovative approach to guitar playing, and this track features agile runs incorporating the Dominant 7#5 arpeggio with speed and precision.\n\nThis arpeggio offers a colorful and sophisticated alternative to traditional dominant arpeggios, making it a valuable tool for musicians looking to expand their harmonic vocabulary and add depth to their playing."}},"__N_SSG":true}

This creates a unique and colorful sound, adding tension and interest to the arpeggiated chord.\n\n## Arpeggio Notes and Intervals\n\n- Root (G)\n- Major third (B)\n- Perfect fifth (D)\n- Added fourth (C)\n\nThe intervals in the arpeggio are a major third from G to B, a minor third from B to C, and a perfect fourth from C to D.\n\n## Musical Flavor and Genre\n\nThe add4 arpeggio in G has a dreamy and ethereal quality, thanks to the tension created by the added fourth note (C).

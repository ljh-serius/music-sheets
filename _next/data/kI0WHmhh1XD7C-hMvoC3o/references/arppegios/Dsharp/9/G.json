In this case, we are looking at an arpeggio based on the 9th note in the key of D# with a fingering shape resembling a G chord. \n\n## Notes and Intervals:\n- D# (root)\n- F## (major 3rd)\n- A# (perfect 5th)\n- C## (minor 7th)\n- E# (9th)\n\n## Genre and Flavor:\nThis particular arpeggio shape can add a jazzy and sophisticated flavor to music. It is commonly used in jazz, fusion, and R&B genres to create a sense of harmony and complexity in the music.\n\n## Songs:\n1. **\"So What\" by Miles Davis**: This jazz standard features arpeggios based on the 9th and other extensions, creating a modal sound with a sense of cool sophistication.\n2. **\"Maputo\" by David Sanborn**: A fusion instrumental that showcases arpeggios like the one we've discussed, adding a modern and intricate touch to the music.\n3. **\"Agua de Beber\" by Antonio Carlos Jobim**: A bossa nova classic where arpeggios are used to enhance the harmonic richness and melodic flow of the song."}},"__N_SSG":true}

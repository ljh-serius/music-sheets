The Dominant 7th arpeggio in B with shape A consists of the notes B (root), D# (major 3rd), F# (perfect 5th), and A (minor 7th). This arpeggio creates a strong tension-resolution effect due to the dissonant interval between the minor 7th and the root note.\n\n## Notes and Intervals:\n- Root (B)\n- Major 3rd (D#)\n- Perfect 5th (F#)\n- Minor 7th (A)\n\n## Musical Flavor:\nThe Dominant 7th arpeggio in B is commonly used in jazz, blues, and funk genres to add color and tension to chord progressions.

This arpeggio can create a sense of movement and groove in music.\n\n## Example Songs:\n1. **\"All Blues\" by Miles Davis** - This jazz classic prominently features Dominant 7th arpeggios in various improvisational sections.\n   \n2. **\"The Thrill is Gone\" by B.B.

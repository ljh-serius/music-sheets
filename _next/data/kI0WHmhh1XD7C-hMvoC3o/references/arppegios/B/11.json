When the 11th note is added to a chord, it creates a richer, more complex sound. In the key of B, the 11th note would be E. Incorporating the 11th into an arpeggio adds an interesting and colorful tone to the chord progression.\n\n## Notes and Intervals:\n\n- B (Root)\n- D# (Major 3rd)\n- F# (Perfect 5th)\n- A# (Major 7th)\n- E (11th)\n\nBy adding the 11th note to the B major chord, it creates a Bmaj11 arpeggio.

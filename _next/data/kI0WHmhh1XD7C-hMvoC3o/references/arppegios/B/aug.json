Augmented arpeggios create a distinct sound due to the sharpness of specific intervals within the chord.\n\n## Breakdown of Notes and Intervals:\n\nThe B augmented arpeggio consists of the following notes: B, D#, and F##. The intervals within this arpeggio are a major third (B to D#) and an augmented fifth (B to F##).\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor:\n\nAugmented arpeggios are commonly found in genres like jazz, avant-garde, and contemporary classical music.

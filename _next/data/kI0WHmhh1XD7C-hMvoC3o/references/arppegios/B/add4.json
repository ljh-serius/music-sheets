The add4 arpeggio specifically involves playing the root, major third, perfect fifth, and major seventh notes of a chord, with an added fourth note above the root. In the key of B, this would consist of the B root note, D# (major third), F# (perfect fifth), A# (major seventh), and E (added fourth). \n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- B (Root)\n- D# (Major third)\n- F# (Perfect fifth)\n- A# (Major seventh)\n- E (Added fourth)\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe add4 arpeggio in B can be utilized in various genres such as jazz, fusion, and progressive rock.

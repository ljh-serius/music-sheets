An augmented arpeggio features a root, a major third, and an augmented fifth. In the case of B augmented arpeggio in A position, the notes would be B - D# - Fx (sharpened fifth note).\n\n## Breakdown of Notes and Intervals\n- B: Root note.\n- D#: Major third above the root.\n- Fx (F double sharp): Augmented fifth above the root.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe augmented arpeggio creates a tense, dissonant sound that can add drama and mystery to a composition. It is often used in genres like jazz, avant-garde, and contemporary classical music to introduce an element of unpredictability and color.\n\n## Example Songs\nHere are three songs that use the B augmented arpeggio in A shape:\n1. \"Eugene's Trick Bag\" by Steve Vai\n2. \"Bolero\" by Maurice Ravel\n3. \"So What\" by Miles Davis"}},"__N_SSG":true}

The Major 7th arpeggio in C, played in the shape of G, consists of the notes C-E-G-B. This arpeggio creates a lush, dreamy sound that is commonly used in jazz, R&B, funk, and other genres to add color and complexity to chord progressions.\n\n### Notes and Intervals\n- C (Root)\n- E (Major 3rd)\n- G (Perfect 5th)\n- B (Major 7th)\n\n### Genre Usage and Musical Flavor\nThe Major 7th arpeggio in C, played in the shape of G, is often used in genres like jazz, R&B, and funk to create a sophisticated and harmonically rich sound.

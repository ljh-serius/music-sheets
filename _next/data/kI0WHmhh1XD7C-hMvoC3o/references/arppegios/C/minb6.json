In the case of a Minor b6th arpeggio in the key of C, we start with C as the root note and then build the arpeggio using the minor 3rd, perfect 5th, and flattened 6th notes of the C minor scale.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- C (Root)\n- E♭ (Minor 3rd)\n- G (Perfect 5th)\n- A♭ (Flattened 6th)\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe Minor b6th arpeggio, with its flattened 6th note, creates a unique tension in the music. This arpeggio is often used in jazz, blues, and classical music to add color and emotion to a piece. It can evoke feelings of melancholy, mystery, or even an exotic flavor depending on how it is used within the musical context.\n\n## Songs\n1. **\"Blue Bossa\" by Kenny Dorham** - This jazz standard features the Minor b6th arpeggio prominently in the melodic lines and improvisations.\n2. **\"Stormy Monday\" by T-Bone Walker** - In this blues classic, the Minor b6th arpeggio is used to create a dark and soulful atmosphere.\n3. **\"Moonlight Sonata\" by Ludwig van Beethoven** - The haunting melody of this classical piece utilizes the Minor b6th arpeggio to convey a sense of longing and introspection."}},"__N_SSG":true}

The arpeggio specified here is the add4 arpeggio in the key of C, which is performed using the G shape on the guitar. This means that the arpeggio notes are derived from the G major chord, but when played over a C root note, it creates a Cadd4 sound.\n\n## Notes and Intervals:\n- **C (Root)**: The primary note of the arpeggio.\n- **E (3rd)**: The major third interval that gives the chord its major quality.\n- **G (5th)**: The perfect fifth interval which provides stability to the chord.\n- **B (7th)**: The major seventh added to the chord which creates tension.\n- **F (4th)**: The major fourth interval, also known as the eleventh when played above the octave, adding color to the chord.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor:\nThe add4 arpeggio in C, played with the G shape, can add a dreamy and ethereal quality to music.

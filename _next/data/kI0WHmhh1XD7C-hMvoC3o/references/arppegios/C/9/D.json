The 9th in a chord refers to the note that is a major or minor ninth above the root note of the chord. In the key of C, the 9th note starting from the root C is D.\n\n## Breakdown of Notes and Intervals:\n- **Root Note**: C\n- **9th Note**: D\n- **Interval Relation**: The 9th note is a whole step (two half steps) above the root note.\n\n## Musical Application and Flavor:\nThe 9th in a chord adds color and tension to the harmony. When played as part of an arpeggio, the 9th can create a jazzy or dreamy sound, depending on the context in which it is used. In the key of C, the 9th note D, when arpeggiated, can evoke a sense of sophistication and longing in the music.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor:\nThe 9th arpeggio in C, particularly in the shape of D, is commonly used in jazz and contemporary music styles. It adds lushness and complexity to chords, making them sound more interesting and harmonically rich. The use of the 9th arpeggio can give a song a smooth and modern flavor, often heard in jazz ballads, neo-soul, and R&B music.\n\n## Example Songs:\nHere are three songs that showcase the use of the 9th arpeggio in the key of C (shape: D):\n1. **\"Misty\" by Erroll Garner**: This jazz standard employs 9th arpeggios extensively in its chord progressions, creating a romantic and nostalgic atmosphere.\n2. **\"Don't Know Why\" by Norah Jones**: The piano accompaniment in this song features the 9th arpeggios, enhancing the laid-back and soulful vibe of the track.\n3. **\"Neo Seoul\" by Tennyson**: In this electronic and jazz-influenced track, the 9th arpeggios add a contemporary and experimental touch to the music.\n\nThese songs demonstrate how the 9th arpeggio in the key of C, shaped as D, can be used effectively across different genres to evoke specific moods and enhance musical expressions."}},"__N_SSG":true}

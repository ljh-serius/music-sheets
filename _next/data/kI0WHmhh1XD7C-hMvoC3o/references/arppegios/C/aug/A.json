An Augmented arpeggio is built from an augmented triad, consisting of the 1st (root), major 3rd, and augmented 5th intervals of a major scale. In the key of C, this would be C, E, and G# respectively.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n\n- **C**: Root\n- **E**: Major 3rd\n- **G#**: Augmented 5th\n\n## Genre and Flavors\n\nThe Augmented arpeggio is commonly used in genres such as jazz, classical, and progressive rock. It adds a sense of tension and dissonance to the music due to the augmented 5th interval, creating a unique and somewhat eerie sound that can evoke feelings of mystery or suspense.\n\n## Songs\n\nHere are three songs that prominently feature the Augmented arpeggio in the key of C:\n\n1. **The Beatles - \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\"**: The iconic opening riff of this psychedelic rock song uses an Augmented arpeggio to create its dreamy and surreal atmosphere.\n   \n2. **Stravinsky - \"The Firebird Suite\"**: This classical masterpiece by Igor Stravinsky features sections where augmented arpeggios are utilized to convey a sense of otherworldly beauty and grandeur.\n   \n3. **King Crimson - \"21st Century Schizoid Man\"**: This progressive rock classic by King Crimson showcases the use of Augmented arpeggios in its intense and adventurous sound, adding a touch of complexity to the music."}},"__N_SSG":true}

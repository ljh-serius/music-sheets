The Augmented arpeggio, in this case in the key of C and with the shape of D, consists of the notes C, E, and G#. This is known as an Augmented chord because it contains a root note (C), a major third (E), and an augmented fifth (G#) which gives it an unresolved and tense sound.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- **Root (C)**: The starting note of the arpeggio, setting the tonal center.\n- **Major 3rd (E)**: Creates a sense of brightness and uplift in the chord.\n- **Augmented 5th (G#)**: The augmented fifth creates tension and dissonance, distinguishing this chord from a traditional major chord.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe Augmented arpeggio is often used in genres like jazz, fusion, and modern classical music. It provides a sense of unease and open-endedness due to the tension between the major third and the augmented fifth. This chord is rarely used as a final resolution, but more as a transitional or colorful element in compositions.\n\n## Songs\n1. **\"Giant Steps\" by John Coltrane**: This iconic jazz composition features complex harmonic movements, including the use of augmented arpeggios to create tension and propel the piece forward.\n2. **\"Dissolution\" by Allan Holdsworth**: The fusion virtuoso Allan Holdsworth frequently employed augmented arpeggios in his compositions, showcasing their unique and dissonant sound.\n3. **\"Lux Aeterna\" by Gy√∂rgy Ligeti**: This contemporary classical piece prominently features dissonant chords and arpeggios, including the Augmented arpeggio in creating a haunting and otherworldly atmosphere.\n\nThis reference sheet will help music students understand and utilize the Augmented arpeggio in their compositions and improvisations."}},"__N_SSG":true}

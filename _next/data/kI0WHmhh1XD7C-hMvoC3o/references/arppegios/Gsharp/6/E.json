In this case, the arpeggio is played starting on the 6th note in the key of G#, using the shape of an E chord. \n\n## Notes and Intervals:\n\n- G# (1st) - Root\n- B# (3rd) - Major Third\n- D# (5th) - Perfect Fifth\n- F## (6th) - Major 6th\n- A# (8th) - Octave\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor:\n\nArpeggios are commonly used in various genres of music, including classical, jazz, rock, and pop. When played with a major 6th interval, as in this arpeggio in G#, it adds a sense of tension and color to the chord progression. The major 6th creates a dreamy and slightly dissonant sound that can evoke emotions ranging from contemplative to melancholic. \n\n## Songs:\n1. **\"Hotel California\" by Eagles**: The iconic intro of the song features an arpeggiated guitar part using a similar arpeggio shape.\n2. **\"Stairway to Heaven\" by Led Zeppelin**: The famous guitar solo in this classic rock song incorporates arpeggios that create a mystical and ethereal atmosphere.\n3. **\"Clair de Lune\" by Claude Debussy**: This classical piano piece showcases arpeggios with the major 6th interval, creating a sense of longing and beauty in the music."}},"__N_SSG":true}

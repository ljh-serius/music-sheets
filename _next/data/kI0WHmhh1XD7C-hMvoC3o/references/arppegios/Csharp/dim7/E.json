The diminished 7th arpeggio is a four-note chord built from the root note, flattened third, flattened fifth, and double-flattened seventh of the major scale. In the key of C#, this would consist of the notes C# (root), E (flattened third), G (flattened fifth), and Bb (double-flattened seventh). When played sequentially, these notes create a dissonant and tense sound characteristic of the diminished chord quality.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n\n- 1. C# (Root)\n- 2. E (Flattened Third)\n- 3. G (Flattened Fifth)\n- 4. Bb (Double-Flattened Seventh)\n\nThe intervals between the notes in this diminished 7th arpeggio are:\n- Root to Flattened Third: a Minor 3rd interval\n- Flattened Third to Flattened Fifth: a Minor 3rd interval\n- Flattened Fifth to Double-Flattened Seventh: a Minor 3rd interval\n\n## Musical Genre and Flavor\n\nDiminished 7th arpeggios are commonly used in jazz, classical, and metal music.

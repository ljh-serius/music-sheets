It consists of the notes C#, E, G#, and B#. The characteristic tone of this arpeggio is the major 7th (B#), which distinguishes it from a regular minor 7th chord.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n\n- C#: Root\n- E: Minor 3rd (3 semitones above C#)\n- G#: Perfect 5th (7 semitones above C#)\n- B#: Major 7th (11 semitones above C#)\n\n## Musical Flavor and Genre\n\nThe Minor Major 7th arpeggio has a unique and somewhat dissonant sound due to the presence of the major 7th interval within a minor chord context.

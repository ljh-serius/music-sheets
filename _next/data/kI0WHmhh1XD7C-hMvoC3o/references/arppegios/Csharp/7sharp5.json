The Dominant 7#5 arpeggio is made up of the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and b7th notes of the major scale, with the 5th note raised by a half step.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n\nIn the key of C#, the Dominant 7#5 arpeggio would consist of the following notes:\n\n- C# (Root)\n- E# (Major 3rd)\n- G# (Perfect 5th)\n- B (Dominant 7th)\n\nThe intervallic structure of these notes in relation to the root would be:\n- Major 3rd (E#)\n- Augmented 5th (G#)\n- Minor 7th (B)\n\n## Musical Flavor and Genre\n\nThe Dominant 7#5 arpeggio has a distinct and colorful sound due to the augmented 5th interval. It adds tension and dissonance to the traditional dominant 7th sound, creating a sense of unpredictability and excitement.\n\nThis arpeggio is commonly used in jazz and fusion genres where musicians seek to incorporate complex harmonic textures and extended chords into their improvisations and compositions. It can add a jazzy and modern flavor to chord progressions and solos.\n\n## Songs\n\nHere are three songs that feature the Dominant 7#5 arpeggio in C#:\n\n1. **\"Giant Steps\" by John Coltrane**: This iconic jazz composition features rapid chord changes and complex harmonic movements, making extensive use of arpeggios including the Dominant 7#5.\n\n2. **\"Birdland\" by Weather Report**: A fusion jazz classic, \"Birdland\" showcases the use of advanced harmonies and augmented chords, including the Dominant 7#5 arpeggio.\n\n3. **\"Spain\" by Chick Corea**: This jazz fusion piece incorporates a variety of advanced chord voicings and arpeggios, including the Dominant 7#5, adding richness and depth to the harmonic structure of the composition."}},"__N_SSG":true}

The \"add4\" designation refers to adding the fourth note of the scale to the chord. When combined with the C# major chord, it creates a C# major add4 arpeggio. This arpeggio adds an additional color tone to the standard triad, creating a richer and more complex sound.\n\n## Breakdown of Notes and Intervals\n- **C#** (Root)\n- **E#** (Major Third)\n- **G#** (Perfect Fifth)\n- **F#** (Added Fourth)\n\nThe intervals in this arpeggio are the major third (4 semitones from the root), perfect fifth (7 semitones from the root), and added fourth (6 semitones from the root).\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe C# major add4 arpeggio can be used in various genres of music, including modern pop, rock, jazz, and fusion. In these genres, the arpeggio adds a dreamy, ethereal, or mysterious quality to the sound due to the tension created by the added fourth. It provides a sense of interest and color that goes beyond traditional triadic harmony, making it a versatile and expressive tool for composers and performers.\n\n## 3 Songs featuring C# Major Add4 Arpeggio\n1. **\"Clocks\" by Coldplay** - The intro of this popular song features a prominent C# major add4 arpeggio, adding a shimmering and introspective quality to the music.\n   \n2. **\"Don't Stop Believin'\" by Journey** - The guitar solo in this classic rock anthem includes instances of the C# major add4 arpeggio, showcasing its versatility in a high-energy context.\n\n3. **\"Spain\" by Chick Corea** - This jazz fusion piece by Chick Corea prominently features extended arpeggios, including the C# major add4, adding sophistication and complexity to the harmonic progression."}},"__N_SSG":true}

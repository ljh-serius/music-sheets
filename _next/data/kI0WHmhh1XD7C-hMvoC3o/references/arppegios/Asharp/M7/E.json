In the case of a Major 7th arpeggio in the key of A# (A sharp) using the E shape, we focus on the 1st (root), 3rd, 5th, and 7th notes of the A# Major 7th chord.\n\n## Notes and Intervals:\n- **A#** (Root)\n- **C** (Major 3rd)\n- **E** (Perfect 5th)\n- **G** (Major 7th)\n\n## Musical Flavor:\nThe Major 7th arpeggio in A# gives a lush, sophisticated, and jazzy sound due to the inclusion of the Major 7th interval. It has a dreamy quality that can evoke emotions of nostalgia, romance, or introspection. This arpeggio is commonly used in jazz, R&B, and soul music to add color and harmonic richness to compositions.\n\n## Songs:\nHere are three songs that prominently feature the Major 7th arpeggio in A# (Shape: E):\n1. *\"Misty\" by Erroll Garner*\n2. *\"Don't Know Why\" by Norah Jones*\n3. *\"My Funny Valentine\" by Chet Baker*"}},"__N_SSG":true}

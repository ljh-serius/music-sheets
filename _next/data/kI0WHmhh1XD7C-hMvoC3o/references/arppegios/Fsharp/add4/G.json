Arpeggios are the notes of a chord played individually in succession rather than simultaneously. The add4 term indicates that the arpeggio contains the chord tones of the root, major third, perfect fifth, and also includes the fourth note of the F# major scale.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- **F# (Root)**\n- **A# (Major Third)**\n- **C# (Perfect Fifth)**\n- **B (Fourth)**\n\nThe intervals in this arpeggio would be a major third between the root (F#) and the major third (A#), a minor third between the major third (A#) and the perfect fifth (C#), and a minor second between the perfect fifth (C#) and the fourth (B).\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThis arpeggio in F# with the added fourth has a dreamy and ethereal quality to it. It introduces a sense of tension and resolution due to the inclusion of the fourth, which differentiates it from a standard major chord arpeggio.

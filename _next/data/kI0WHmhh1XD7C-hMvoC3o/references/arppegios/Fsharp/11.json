In the context of an 11th arpeggio in F#, this means playing the notes of an F#11 chord in a sequential manner. The F#11 chord consists of the notes F#, A#, C#, E#, and G#.\n\n---\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n\n- Root (F#)\n- Major 3rd (A#)\n- Perfect 5th (C#)\n- Minor 7th (E#)\n- Major 9th (G#)\n- Perfect 11th (C# an octave higher than the first C#)\n\n---\n\n## Musical Genre and Flavor\n\nThe F#11 arpeggio can be used in various genres of music, often found in jazz, fusion, and some forms of rock. It adds color and complexity to the harmony due to the inclusion of the 7th, 9th, and 11th intervals. The flavor it gives is rich and jazzy, with a sense of tension and release due to the dissonant intervals found within the arpeggio.\n\n---\n\n## 3 Songs\n\n1. **\"Spain\" by Chick Corea** - This jazz fusion classic features intricate arpeggios and utilizes complex chord structures, including extended arpeggios like the F#11.\n   \n2. **\"Giant Steps\" by John Coltrane** - A jazz standard renowned for its harmonic complexity, \"Giant Steps\" includes arpeggios and chords with extended intervals, similar to the F#11 arpeggio.\n   \n3. **\"Bohemian Rhapsody\" by Queen** - Although not primarily jazz, Queen's iconic song showcases Brian May's use of arpeggios in the guitar solo, demonstrating how arpeggios can be incorporated into various genres."}},"__N_SSG":true}

In the context of music theory, the 6th arpeggio in the key of F# would involve playing the 1st (F#), 3rd (A#), and 5th (C#) notes of the F# major scale in sequence.\n\n---\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n\nIn the key of F#, the 6th arpeggio is built upon the notes F# (1st), A# (3rd), and C# (5th). Breakdown of intervals:\n\n- F# to A#: major 3rd\n- A# to C#: minor 3rd\n\nThis sequence creates a harmony that is unique and provides a different flavor compared to playing all the notes together.\n\n---\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\n\nArpeggios are commonly used in various genres of music, including classical, rock, and jazz. The 6th arpeggio in F# adds a sense of tension and resolution due to the combination of the major and minor thirds.

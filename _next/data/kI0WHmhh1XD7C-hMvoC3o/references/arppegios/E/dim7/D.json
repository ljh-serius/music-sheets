This arpeggio is a series of these four notes played individually in sequence. It creates a dissonant, tense sound due to the diminished 5th interval between the E and Bb, and the diminished 7th interval between the E and Db.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- **E** to **G** - Minor 3rd interval\n- **G** to **Bb** - Minor 3rd interval\n- **Bb** to **Db** - Minor 3rd interval\n\nThis arpeggio does not feature a perfect 5th interval, which is a characteristic of diminished chords.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe Diminished 7th arpeggio is commonly used in jazz, metal, and classical music. In jazz, it adds tension and color to improvisations. In metal, it contributes to a dark and aggressive sound. In classical music, it can create a sense of dissonance and unease before resolving to a more stable chord.\n\n## Songs\nHere are three songs that use the Diminished 7th arpeggio in E:\n\n1. **\"Giant Steps\" by John Coltrane**: This jazz standard features rapid chord changes, including the Diminished 7th arpeggio, challenging many musicians due to its harmonic complexity.\n   \n2. **\"Black Sabbath\" by Black Sabbath**: The intro riff of this iconic heavy metal song uses the Diminished 7th arpeggio to establish a sinister and heavy atmosphere.\n   \n3. **\"Liebestraum No. 3\" by Franz Liszt**: This classical piano piece includes passages that utilize the Diminished 7th arpeggio to create moments of tension and drama in the music."}},"__N_SSG":true}

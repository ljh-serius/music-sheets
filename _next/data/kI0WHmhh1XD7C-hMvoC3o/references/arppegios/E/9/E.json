In this case, we are looking at the 9th arpeggio in the key of E.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- E (Root)\n- F# (Major 2nd)\n- G# (Major 3rd)\n- B (Perfect 5th)\n- D# (Major 7th)\n- F# (Major 2nd) - An octave higher than the previous F#\n- G# (Major 3rd) - An octave higher than the previous G#\n- B (Perfect 5th) - An octave higher than the previous B\n- D# (Major 7th) - An octave higher than the previous D#\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThis arpeggio in E can be frequently found in genres like jazz, fusion, and neo-soul. The 9th arpeggio gives a jazzy and sophisticated flavor to the music. It is often used to add color and richness to chord progressions. The dissonance created by the major 7th interval (D#) adds a sense of tension and release, contributing to the overall harmonic complexity.\n\n## Songs\nHere are three songs that feature the 9th arpeggio in E:\n1. \"Spain\" by Chick Corea - This jazz fusion classic prominently features arpeggios and showcases the harmonic richness of the 9th arpeggio.\n2. \"I Wish\" by Stevie Wonder - This funk/soul hit incorporates jazzy elements including arpeggios with extended chords, including the 9th arpeggio in E.\n3. \"Cantaloupe Island\" by Herbie Hancock - A jazz standard that highlights the use of arpeggios and extended chords, including the 9th arpeggio, in a funky and groovy context."}},"__N_SSG":true}

In this case, we are looking at a suspended 2nd (sus2) arpeggio in the key of E major.\n\n## Notes and Intervals:\n- E (Root)\n- F# (Major 2nd)\n- B (Perfect 5th)\n\nThe sus2 arpeggio replaces the major 3rd of a major chord with the major 2nd, creating a dreamy and unresolved sound.\n\n## Genre and Flavor:\nThe sus2 arpeggio, with its ethereal and suspended quality, is often used in genres like dream pop, ambient music, and singer-songwriter ballads. It creates a sense of openness and longing in the music, adding a touch of mystery and emotion to the overall sound.\n\n## Example Songs:\n1. **\"Yellow\" by Coldplay**: The intro guitar riff in this iconic song features sus2 arpeggios, contributing to its ambient and uplifting vibe.\n   \n2. **\"Skinny Love\" by Bon Iver**: The guitar picking pattern in this song utilizes sus2 arpeggios, enhancing the introspective and melancholic feel of the music.\n   \n3. **\"Half of My Heart\" by John Mayer**: This song showcases sus2 arpeggios on the guitar, adding a wistful and contemplative element to the chord progression."}},"__N_SSG":true}

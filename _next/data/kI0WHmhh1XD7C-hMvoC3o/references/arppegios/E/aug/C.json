The Augmented Arpeggio is created by playing the root note, a major third above the root, and then another major third above that. In the key of E, an augmented arpeggio using the C shape includes the notes E, G#, and C.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- E (Root)\n- G# (Major 3rd)\n- C (Major 3rd)\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe Augmented Arpeggio carries a sense of tension and instability due to the augmented fifth interval between the root and the third note. It is often used in genres that aim to create a sense of dissonance or that want to introduce an element of surprise in the music.

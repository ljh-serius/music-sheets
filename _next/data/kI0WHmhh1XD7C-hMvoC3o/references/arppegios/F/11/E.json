The 11th arpeggio in the key of F, using the E shape, creates a lush and harmonically rich sound.\n\n## Notes and Intervals:\n\n- **F (root)**\n- **A (3rd)**\n- **C (5th)**\n- **E (7th)**\n- **G (9th)**\n- **Bb (11th)**\n\nThe interval structures in this arpeggio are Root - 3rd - 5th - 7th - 9th - 11th.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor:\n\nThis arpeggio, with its inclusion of the 11th, has a jazzy and sophisticated quality. It is often used in jazz and R&B genres to add color and depth to chord progressions. The 11th interval provides a pleasant dissonance that resolves nicely, giving a modern and slightly unconventional flavor to the music.\n\n## Three Songs:\n\n1. **\"So What\" by Miles Davis**: This jazz standard features 11th arpeggios heavily in its chord progressions, contributing to its cool and modal sound.\n   \n2. **\"Butterfly\" by Herbie Hancock**: A fusion jazz piece that showcases the 11th arpeggios in a contemporary and exploratory musical context.\n   \n3. **\"What's Going On\" by Marvin Gaye**: This soul classic uses 11th arpeggios to create a soulful and complex harmonic backdrop, contributing to the song's iconic sound."}},"__N_SSG":true}

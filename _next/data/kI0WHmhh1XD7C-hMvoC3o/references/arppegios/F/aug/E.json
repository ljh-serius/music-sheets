An augmented arpeggio creates a sense of tension and dissonance due to the augmented fifth interval within the arpeggio.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n\nFor an augmented arpeggio in the key of F with the E shape, the notes involved would be F, A#, and C#. The intervals within this arpeggio would consist of a major third between F and A#, and then an augmented fifth between A# and C#.\n\n## Genres and Musical Flavor\n\nAugmented arpeggios, with their characteristic dissonance, are often used in genres like classical music to create tension and drama within a composition. They can also be found in jazz, progressive rock, and metal music where musicians want to add a sense of unease or mystery to their pieces.\n\n## Songs\n\nHere are three songs that feature the augmented arpeggio in F with the E shape:\n\n1. \"Purple Haze\" by Jimi Hendrix - The iconic guitar riff in this song prominently features augmented arpeggios, adding a psychedelic and edgy flavor to the music.\n\n2. \"The Dance of Eternity\" by Dream Theater - This prog-metal instrumental showcases complex and fast arpeggios, including augmented ones, to create a sense of urgency and technical prowess.\n\n3. \"Prelude in C# minor\" by Sergei Rachmaninoff - A classical piece that uses augmented arpeggios to evoke a sense of melancholy and intensity in the music."}},"__N_SSG":true}

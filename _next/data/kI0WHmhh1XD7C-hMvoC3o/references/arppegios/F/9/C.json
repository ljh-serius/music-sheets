They consist of playing the notes of a chord individually rather than simultaneously. This particular arpeggio is the 9th in the key of F, utilizing the shape of a C chord. The 9th in a chord refers to the note that is a whole step above the octave of the root note.\n\n### Notes and Intervals:\n- **Root (F)**\n- **Major 3rd (A)**\n- **Perfect 5th (C)**\n- **Major 7th (E)**\n- **Major 9th (G)**\n\n### Musical Flavor and Genre:\nThe 9th arpeggio in F with the C shape gives a dreamy and ethereal sound to the music. It adds a sense of anticipation and color due to the dissonance created by the 9th interval. This arpeggio is commonly used in jazz, R&B, and neo-soul genres to evoke a sophisticated and modern feel in the music.\n\n### Example Songs:\n1. \"So What\" by Miles Davis\n2. \"Redbone\" by Childish Gambino\n3. \"Don't Know Why\" by Norah Jones"}},"__N_SSG":true}

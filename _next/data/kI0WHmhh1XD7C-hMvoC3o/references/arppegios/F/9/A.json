The 9th in F arpeggio, using the A shape, involves playing the notes of an F chord individually - F, A, C, and E - with the added 9th note, which is G.\n\n### Notes and Intervals:\n- F (root)\n- A (major third)\n- C (perfect fifth)\n- E (major seventh)\n- G (major ninth)\n\n### Genre and Musical Flavor:\nThis arpeggio, commonly used in jazz, fusion, and R&B music, provides a colorful and sophisticated sound to the music. The addition of the 9th (G) note adds tension and interest to the chord progression, giving it a modern and jazzy flavor.\n\n### Songs:\n1. \"Chameleon\" by Herbie Hancock\n2. \"Spain\" by Chick Corea\n3. \"So What\" by Miles Davis"}},"__N_SSG":true}

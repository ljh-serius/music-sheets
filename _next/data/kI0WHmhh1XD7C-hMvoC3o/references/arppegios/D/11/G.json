The 11th in D arpeggio refers to playing the 11th note in the D major scale in an arpeggiated fashion. In this case, it is played using the G shape on the guitar fretboard.\n\n## Notes and Intervals:\n\n- D (Root)\n- F# (3rd)\n- A (5th)\n- C# (7th)\n- E (9th)\n- G (11th)\n\nThis arpeggio includes the root, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th notes of the D major scale.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor:\n\nThis arpeggio, with its extended range up to the 11th note, adds color and tension to the sound. It is commonly used in jazz, fusion, and some progressive rock genres. The use of the 11th in a major chord gives it a more complex and jazzy flavor compared to a standard major arpeggio.\n\n## Songs Featuring the 11th in D Arpeggio (Shape: G):\n\n1. **\"Giant Steps\" by John Coltrane**: This jazz standard features fast-moving chord changes where the 11th arpeggio can be heard in various improvisational sections.\n\n2. **\"YYZ\" by Rush**: The intro section of this progressive rock classic by Rush showcases arpeggiated patterns incorporating extended chord tones, including the 11th.\n\n3. **\"The Chicken\" by Jaco Pastorius**: A funk/jazz fusion track that prominently features arpeggios and extended chord tones, including the 11th, in its bassline and soloing sections."}},"__N_SSG":true}

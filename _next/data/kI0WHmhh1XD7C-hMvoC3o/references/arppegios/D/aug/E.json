In this case, we are looking at an **augmented arpeggio** in the key of D, using the E shape. This means that we will be playing the notes of a D augmented chord one at a time in a sequence.\n\n## Notes and Intervals:\n- D (Root)\n- F# (#3rd)\n- A# (#5th)\n\nWhen played in the E shape, the notes are spread across the fretboard in a specific pattern that creates the augmented sound.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor:\nThe augmented arpeggio in D (E shape) delivers a particular sound that can be described as dissonant and suspenseful. It creates tension due to the augmented quality of the chord. This type of arpeggio can be used effectively in various genres such as jazz, progressive rock, and fusion to add color and complexity to a musical piece.\n\n## Songs:\n1. **\"The Chicken\" by Jaco Pastorius**  \n   Jaco Pastorius, the legendary bassist, uses augmented arpeggios in this jazz-fusion classic to add an element of tension and flair to his bass lines.\n\n2. **\"Glasgow Kiss\" by John Petrucci**  \n   In this instrumental piece by John Petrucci from Dream Theater, you can hear the augmented arpeggios creating a sense of urgency and drama in the guitar solos.\n\n3. **\"Spain\" by Chick Corea**  \n   Chick Corea's masterpiece \"Spain\" features augmented arpeggios played on the piano, showcasing how this arpeggio can be used to create a sense of harmonic richness and excitement in jazz music."}},"__N_SSG":true}

A diminished arpeggio is a chord made up of a root note, a minor third, and a diminished fifth. In the key of D, a diminished arpeggio would consist of the notes D, F, and Ab.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- D (root note)\n- F (minor third)\n- Ab (diminished fifth)\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nDiminished arpeggios are often used in various genres such as jazz, metal, and classical music. They have a dark and tense sound due to the dissonant intervals in the chord.

It is built by raising the fifth of a major chord by a half step. In the key of B, using the G shape on the guitar, an augmented chord consists of the notes B (root), D# (major third), and F## (augmented fifth).\n\n## Notes and Intervals:\n- Root: B\n- Major Third: D#\n- Augmented Fifth: F##\n\n## Genre and Flavor:\nThe augmented chord is often used in jazz and avant-garde music to create a sense of unease or instability. It can add a mysterious or dreamlike quality to a composition. When used in a progression, it can create tension that resolves either to a stable chord or continues to build intensity.\n\n## Songs:\n1. \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" by The Beatles\n2. \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\" by The Beatles\n3. \"Beautiful Love\" by Bill Evans"}},"__N_SSG":true}

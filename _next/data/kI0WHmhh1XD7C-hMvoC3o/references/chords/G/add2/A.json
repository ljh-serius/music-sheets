By adding the second note of the G major scale (the A note) to the standard G major triad (G, B, D), you create a layered and richer sound while still maintaining the fundamental G major tonality.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- G (root)\n- A (major 2nd/add2)\n- B (major 3rd)\n- D (perfect 5th)\n\nThe interval between the G and A notes creates a major 2nd interval, hence the name \"add2.\" This interval adds depth and color to the chord without altering the basic major quality of the G major triad.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe add2 chord in G (Shape: A) is often used in various genres, including pop, folk, and singer-songwriter music.

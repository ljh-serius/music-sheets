It is constructed by taking a major chord and raising the fifth by a half step. In the specific case of the D# augmented chord in the shape of G, we are starting with the notes D# (root), G (third), and A# (fifth) to create a dissonant and vibrant sound.\n\n# Notes and Intervals\n\n- **Root** - D#\n- **Major Third** - G\n- **Augmented Fifth** - A#\n\nThe intervallic distance between the root and the major third is 4 half steps (major third), and between the third and the augmented fifth is 4 half steps (augmented fifth). The augmented chord's unique sound comes from the tension created by the augmented fifth, giving it an unsettled and restless quality.\n\n# Genre and Musical Flavor\n\nThe augmented chord is often used in genres that require tension, dissonance, or a sense of ambiguity. It is prominent in jazz, avant-garde, and experimental music due to its unstable and unresolved nature. When used in compositions, the augmented chord creates a sense of suspense and leads to unexpected resolutions, adding a touch of mystery and intrigue to the music.\n\n# Songs\n\n1. **The Beatles - \"Because\"**  \n   This iconic song by The Beatles features an augmented chord in the famous vocal harmonies. The augmented chord adds a magical and ethereal quality to the song, enhancing its dreamlike atmosphere.\n\n2. **Igor Stravinsky - \"The Rite of Spring\"**  \n   The groundbreaking ballet and orchestral work by Stravinsky include the use of augmented chords to create tension and dissonance, adding to the chaotic and primal energy of the music.\n\n3. **Thelonious Monk - \"Epistrophy\"**  \n   Jazz pianist Thelonious Monk often incorporated augmented chords in his compositions to create a sense of unpredictability and angularity in his improvisations. \"Epistrophy\" is a classic example of his experimental use of chords in jazz."}},"__N_SSG":true}

When played in the Locrian mode and starting on the note E, it creates a unique tonality that differs from the traditional major scale sound. This scale has a distinct color due to the lowered 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, and 7th degrees of the scale.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- **E (Root)**\n- F (Minor 2nd)\n- **G# (Major 3rd)**\n- **A (Perfect 4th)**\n- **B (Perfect 5th)**\n- C (Minor 6th)\n- D (Minor 7th)\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe Major Scale in G# played in the Locrian mode is a rare and exotic choice in music.

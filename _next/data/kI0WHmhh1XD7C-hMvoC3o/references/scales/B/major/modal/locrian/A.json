In the key of B, the Major scale consists of seven notes: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, and A#. When played in the Locrian mode and using Shape A on the guitar, it provides a unique and somewhat dissonant sound due to the flat 2nd, flat 3rd, flat 5th, flat 6th, and flat 7th degrees compared to the traditional Major scale.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n\n- B (Root)\n- C# (Major 2nd/Flat 9)\n- D# (Major 3rd/Sharp 9)\n- E (Perfect 4th/Flat 5)\n- F# (Perfect 5th)\n- G# (Major 6th/Flat 13)\n- A# (Major 7th)\n- B (Octave) \n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\n\nThe Major scale in B, played in the Locrian mode, offers a distinct and dark flavor to music. It is commonly used in genres like progressive rock, jazz fusion, and experimental music where musicians and composers want to explore dissonance and create tension in their compositions. The Locrian mode built on the Major scale in B provides a unique harmonic color that can be both intriguing and challenging to work with, offering a departure from more conventional and consonant tonalities.\n\n## Songs\n\n1. **Song:** \"Fracture\"  \n   **Artist:** King Crimson  \n   **Description:** This instrumental piece by King Crimson prominently features the Locrian mode in the key of B, creating a complex and captivating musical landscape.\n\n2. **Song:** \"Existence\"  \n   **Artist:** Animals As Leaders  \n   **Description:** \"Existence\" showcases the Major scale in B played in the Locrian mode within a progressive metal context, demonstrating the scale's versatility in modern music.\n\n3. **Song:** \"Giant Steps\"  \n   **Artist:** John Coltrane  \n   **Description:** While not in the exact key of B, John Coltrane's \"Giant Steps\" incorporates elements of the Major scale in the Locrian mode, highlighting its application in jazz improvisation."}},"__N_SSG":true}

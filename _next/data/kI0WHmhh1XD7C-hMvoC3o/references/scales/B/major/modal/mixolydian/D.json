In the key of B, the major scale consists of the following notes: B, C#, D#, E, F#, G#, A#, and B. When played in the Mixolydian mode, the major scale takes on a slightly different flavor due to the lowered seventh scale degree. This gives it a more bluesy or rock sound compared to the traditional major scale. \n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- B (Root)\n- C# (Major 2nd)\n- D# (Major 3rd)\n- E (Perfect 4th)\n- F# (Perfect 5th)\n- G# (Major 6th)\n- A# (Minor 7th)\n- B (Octave)\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe Mixolydian mode, particularly in the key of B, is often found in rock, blues, and folk music.

It is created by following the intervals of the melodic minor scale starting from B. This particular scale has a unique and exotic sound due to the altered intervals it contains compared to the regular major and minor scales.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- B (root)\n- C# (major 2nd)\n- D (minor 3rd)\n- E (perfect 4th)\n- F# (perfect 5th)\n- G# (major 6th)\n- A# (major 7th)\n- B (octave)\n\nThe melodic minor scale is characterized by the raised 6th and 7th degrees when ascending, while it typically reverts to the natural minor scale when descending.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe melodic scale in B is often used in jazz, fusion, and world music.

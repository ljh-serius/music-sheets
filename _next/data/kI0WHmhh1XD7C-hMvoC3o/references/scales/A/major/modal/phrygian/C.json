It consists of a series of whole and half steps that create a bright and uplifting sound. When played in the Phrygian mode starting from A, it takes on a darker, more exotic quality due to the lowered second scale degree compared to a traditional major scale.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\nThe major scale in A consists of the following notes and intervals:\n- A (Root) - Whole Step - B (Major 2nd) - Half Step - C (Major 3rd) - Whole Step - D (Perfect 4th) - Whole Step - E (Perfect 5th) - Whole Step - F (Major 6th) - Whole Step - G (Major 7th) - Half Step - A (Octave)\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe major scale in A, played in the Phrygian mode, is often used in various genres including flamenco, metal, and some forms of jazz.

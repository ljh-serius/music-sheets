In this case, we are looking at the A Major scale played from the 7th note, which is G#. This creates the Locrian mode, characterized by its dissonant and unstable sound.\n\n### Notes and Intervals\n1. A (Root)\n2. B (Major 2nd)\n3. C (Minor 3rd)\n4. D (Perfect 4th)\n5. E (Perfect 5th)\n6. F (Minor 6th)\n7. G# (Diminished 7th)\n8. A (Octave)\n\n### Musical Flavor\nThe Major scale in the Locrian mode, particularly in A, has a dark and unsettling quality due to the presence of the diminished 7th interval. It is not commonly used in mainstream music due to its dissonant nature but can add tension and a sense of unease when applied effectively in compositions.\n\n### Genre and Usage\nThis scale is often used in jazz, fusion, and experimental music where musicians seek to push boundaries and explore dissonant harmonies. It is less conventional in popular music but can be found in progressive rock and metal genres where musicians want to create a sense of tension and unpredictability in their compositions.\n\n### Songs\n1. **\"Locrian Beach\"** by Animals as Leaders – This instrumental piece showcases the Locrian mode in a progressive metal context, highlighting the scale's unique and experimental sound.\n   \n2. **\"Eronel\"** by Thelonious Monk – A jazz composition that features elements of the Locrian mode, demonstrating its application in a more traditional genre but still bringing out its dissonant qualities.\n\n3. **\"Disease, Injury, Madness\"** by Between the Buried and Me – This progressive metal track incorporates the Locrian mode to create a dark and intense atmosphere, showcasing the scale's versatility in heavier musical styles."}},"__N_SSG":true}

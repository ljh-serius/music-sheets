When played using shape E, it follows a specific pattern of intervals between the notes, creating a distinct musical flavor.\n\n### Notes and Intervals\n- F (root)\n- Gb (minor 2nd)\n- Ab (minor 3rd)\n- Bb (diminished 4th)\n- Cb (flattened 5th)\n- Db (minor 6th)\n- Eb (minor 7th)\n\n### Genre and Flavor\nThe Locrian mode is considered dissonant and unstable due to the flattened 5th interval. Its unique sound finds less common usage in mainstream music. However, it can be incorporated in jazz or experimental compositions to add tension and color to the music.\n\n### Songs\nThree songs that utilize the Major Scale in F (Mode: Locrian, Shape E):\n1. \"Frizznine\" by Chon\n2. \"The Dew\" by Hella\n3. \"Nocturne in Do M\" by The Mars Volta"}},"__N_SSG":true}

It is known for its bright and uplifting sound, often associated with feelings of joy and positivity. When played in the Locrian mode and starting on C#, it takes on a darker and more dissonant quality due to the intervals within the Locrian mode.\n\n## Notes and Intervals:\n- C# (root)\n- D# (major second)\n- E (minor third)\n- F# (perfect fourth)\n- G# (diminished fifth)\n- A (minor sixth)\n- B (minor seventh)\n- C# (octave)\n\nThe intervals in the Major scale follow the pattern: whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, whole step, half step.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor:\nThe Major scale in the Locrian mode is not commonly used in mainstream music due to its dissonant and unresolved sound. It creates a tense and unstable feeling that is often more suitable for experimental or avant-garde genres. The Locrian mode is the least common mode in Western music due to its unstable nature.\n\n## Songs that Use the Major Scale in C# (Locrian Mode):\n1. \"Chaos and the Primordial\" by John Zorn - This avant-garde composition features elements of the C# Major scale in the Locrian mode, creating a chaotic and unpredictable sonic landscape.\n2. \"Dissonant Serenity\" by Experimental Noise Collective - This experimental piece explores the dark and dissonant qualities of the C# Major scale in the Locrian mode, evoking a sense of unease and tension.\n3. \"Lost in the Abyss\" by Atonal Ensemble - Incorporating the Locrian mode in the key of C#, this atonal composition pushes the boundaries of traditional harmony, creating a haunting and otherworldly atmosphere."}},"__N_SSG":true}

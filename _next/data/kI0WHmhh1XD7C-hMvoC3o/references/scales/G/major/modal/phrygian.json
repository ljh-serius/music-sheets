In this specific case, we are focusing on the G major scale but using its third mode, which corresponds to the Phrygian mode. The Phrygian mode has a distinct sound due to its interval pattern.\n\n## Notes and Intervals:\n- G (root)\n- A (major 2nd)\n- Bb (minor 3rd)\n- C (perfect 4th)\n- D (perfect 5th)\n- E (major 6th)\n- F (minor 7th)\n- G (octave)\n\nThe Phrygian mode has a minor 2nd interval between the root note and the second note, giving it a somewhat dark and exotic sound compared to the standard major scale.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor:\nThe Phrygian mode is often associated with Flamenco music, as well as some forms of metal and rock where a darker, more aggressive sound is desired. It has a mysterious and exotic flavor that can add tension and drama to musical compositions.\n\n## Songs:\n1. \"Enter Sandman\" by Metallica - This iconic metal song features sections in the Phrygian mode, contributing to its heavy and intense sound.\n2. \"Malague√±a\" by Ernesto Lecuona - A famous Flamenco piece that prominently uses the Phrygian mode, adding a passionate and flamboyant flair to the music.\n3. \"Black Star\" by Yngwie Malmsteen - A neoclassical metal instrumental that showcases the Phrygian mode in virtuosic guitar passages, highlighting its aggressive and exotic qualities."}},"__N_SSG":true}

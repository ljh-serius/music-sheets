In this case, we will explore the E Major scale but approached from the perspective of the Phrygian mode. The Phrygian mode is the third mode of the Major scale pattern and has a distinct sound due to its flattened 2nd scale degree, which gives it a darker and more exotic feel compared to the typical Major scale.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\nThe E Major scale in the Phrygian mode contains the following notes and corresponding intervals:\n\n- E (Root)\n- F (Minor 2nd)\n- G# (Major 3rd)\n- A (Perfect 4th)\n- B (Perfect 5th)\n- C (Minor 6th)\n- D (Minor 7th)\n\nThe unique characteristic of the Phrygian mode is the flat 2nd scale degree, which in this case is the F note. This note creates dissonance and tension, contributing to the distinct sound of the Phrygian mode.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe E Major scale in the Phrygian mode is often used in various genres to add a touch of exoticism and tension to the music.

Here is a breakdown of this scale entity.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- **C** (Root)\n- **D** (Major 2nd)\n- **Eb** (Minor 3rd)\n- **F** (Perfect 4th)\n- **G** (Perfect 5th)\n- **Ab** (Minor 6th)\n- **Bb** (Minor 7th)\n\nThis scale has a dark and dissonant sound due to the flattened second, third, fifth, sixth, and seventh compared to the regular major scale.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe Locrian mode is the seventh mode of the major scale and is considered unstable due to the diminished triad that occurs on the tonic. It's rarely used in its pure form due to its dissonant nature, but it can add tension and unresolved qualities to music. It can be found occasionally in jazz and metal genres where musicians want to create a sense of urgency or unease in their compositions.\n\n## Example Songs\n1. \"YYZ\" by Rush - The bassline in this instrumental song by Rush features sections that use the Locrian mode, specifically in the intro.\n   \n2. \"Dream On\" by Aerosmith - The guitar solo by Joe Perry in this classic rock song features sections that incorporate the Locrian mode, adding a sense of tension.\n   \n3. \"Sarcophagus\" by Nile - This death metal band uses the Locrian mode to create an intense and dark atmosphere in their music."}},"__N_SSG":true}

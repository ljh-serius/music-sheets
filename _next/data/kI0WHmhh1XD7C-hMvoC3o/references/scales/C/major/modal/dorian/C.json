In this specific case, the mode is Dorian and the scale is rooted in C.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\nThe C major scale consists of the following notes and intervals in the Dorian mode:\n\n- C (Root)\n- D (Major 2nd)\n- E (Minor 3rd)\n- F (Perfect 4th)\n- G (Perfect 5th)\n- A (Major 6th)\n- Bb (Minor 7th)\n- C (Octave)\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe major scale in C, particularly in the Dorian mode, is often used in various styles of music, including jazz, rock, folk, and pop. The Dorian mode adds a unique flavor to the basic major scale by incorporating a minor 3rd and a minor 7th, resulting in a slightly darker and more jazzy sound compared to the traditional major scale.\n\n## Songs\nHere are three songs that utilize the major scale in C with a Dorian mode:\n\n1. **\"So What\" by Miles Davis** - This jazz standard famously uses the Dorian mode throughout, creating a modal jazz masterpiece.\n   \n2. **\"Oye Como Va\" by Tito Puente / Santana** - This Latin-influenced rock classic features the use of the Dorian mode in its guitar solo section.\n   \n3. **\"Scar Tissue\" by Red Hot Chili Peppers** - The main guitar riff in this song is based on the C major scale in the Dorian mode, giving it a melodic and melancholic feel."}},"__N_SSG":true}

In the Harmonic minor scale, the seventh note is raised by a half step compared to the natural minor scale. This alteration creates a unique sound that is both dark and exotic, adding tension and drama to the music. In the key of C, the Harmonic minor scale consists of the following notes: C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, B, and C.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- C (1)\n- D (2)\n- Eb (b3)\n- F (4)\n- G (5)\n- Ab (b6)\n- B (7)\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe Harmonic minor scale is commonly used in music genres that require a touch of mystery, drama, or exoticism. It is often found in genres such as classical music, flamenco, metal, and certain styles of jazz. The raised seventh note creates a distinctive interval known as the augmented second between the sixth and seventh degrees of the scale, which contributes to its unique sound. This scale can evoke a wide range of emotions, from melancholy and longing to intensity and suspense.\n\n## Songs\nHere are three songs that prominently feature the Harmonic minor scale in the key of C:\n\n1. \"Asturias (Leyenda)\" by Isaac Albéniz - This classical guitar piece, part of the Suite Española, showcases the rich and haunting sound of the Harmonic minor scale in a flamenco-inspired composition.\n   \n2. \"Hallowed Be Thy Name\" by Iron Maiden - The intro and various sections of this heavy metal classic use the Harmonic minor scale to create a dark and powerful atmosphere.\n   \n3. \"Sketches of Spain\" by Miles Davis - This jazz album features elements of Spanish music and prominently uses the Harmonic minor scale to infuse the music with exotic flavors and textures."}},"__N_SSG":true}

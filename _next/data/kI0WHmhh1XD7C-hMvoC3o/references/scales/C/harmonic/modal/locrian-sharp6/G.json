This scale features a unique and exotic sound due to its particular intervals and harmonic qualities.\n\n## Notes and Intervals:\nThe Harmonic in C scale includes the following notes and intervals:\n- C (Root)\n- D (Minor 2nd)\n- D# (Major 2nd)\n- F (Diminished 5th)\n- G (Minor 6th)\n- G# (Major 6th)\n- B (Minor 3rd)\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor:\nThis scale is often used in jazz, fusion, and experimental music genres where musicians want to introduce tension and dissonance into their compositions. The Locrian #6 mode, with its flattened fifth and augmented sixth, creates a dark and mysterious musical flavor that deviates from more traditional harmonic structures.\n\n## Songs:\nHere are three songs that use the Harmonic in C scale (Locrian #6 mode with a G shape):\n1. **\"Nefertiti\" by Wayne Shorter**: This jazz composition features elements of the Locrian #6 mode, adding an exotic and avant-garde touch to the harmonic progressions.\n  \n2. **\"Eronel\" by Thelonious Monk**: Thelonious Monk's innovative use of scales and modes can be heard in this tune, where the Harmonic in C scale is subtly woven into the melody and improvisational sections.\n  \n3. **\"Event Horizon\" by Tigran Hamasyan**: A modern fusion piece that incorporates complex harmonies and scales, including the Harmonic in C scale, to create a rich and textured sonic landscape."}},"__N_SSG":true}

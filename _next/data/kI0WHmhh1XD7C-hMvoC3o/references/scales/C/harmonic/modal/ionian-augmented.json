It is derived from the C major scale by raising the fifth note by a half step. This alteration gives the scale a distinct sound that sets it apart from more traditional scales.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- C (1)\n- D (2)\n- E (3)\n- F# (#4)\n- G# (#5)\n- A (6)\n- B (7)\n\nThis scale contains a major third (E), perfect fourth (F#), augmented fifth (G#), and major sixth (A). The augmented fifth (G#) is what distinguishes the harmonic in C from the regular C major scale.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe harmonic scale in C is not as commonly used as some other scales, but it can evoke a sense of mystery and tension in your music. It is often used in genres like jazz, fusion, and experimental music where musicians are looking to create a more dissonant and complex sound.\n\nThe augmented fifth in this scale can create a sense of unease or anticipation, making it ideal for adding a bit of drama to your compositions. It can be used to transition between different chords or as a standalone scale for improvisation or melodic lines.\n\n## Songs\nIf you want to hear the harmonic scale in C in action, here are three songs that showcase its unique sound:\n1. \"Giant Steps\" by John Coltrane - This jazz classic features complex harmonic progressions that make use of augmented intervals.\n2. \"Boogie Stupid\" by Snarky Puppy - This modern fusion band often incorporates exotic scales like the harmonic in C to create their signature sound.\n3. \"The Maze\" by Herbie Hancock - Another jazz legend, Herbie Hancock, is known for his innovative use of scales and harmony, and you can hear the harmonic scale in C in some of his compositions."}},"__N_SSG":true}

In the key of C, the Melodic minor scale consists of the following notes: C, D, Eb, F, G, A, B.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- C - Root\n- D - Major 2nd\n- Eb - Minor 3rd\n- F - Perfect 4th\n- G - Perfect 5th\n- A - Major 6th\n- B - Major 7th\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe Melodic minor scale is often used in jazz, fusion, and classical music. It has a unique sound that can evoke a sense of tension and release due to the augmented 2nd interval between the 6th and 7th degrees of the scale when ascending. This scale allows for various melodic possibilities, adding a touch of exoticism to compositions.\n\n## Songs\nHere are three songs that use the Melodic minor scale in their melodies or solos:\n1. \"Giant Steps\" by John Coltrane\n2. \"Spain\" by Chick Corea\n3. \"Black Orpheus\" by Luiz Bonf√°"}},"__N_SSG":true}

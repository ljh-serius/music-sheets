This scale is also sometimes referred to as the Lydian b7 scale. Its distinctive raised fourth and minor seventh create a sense of tension and lend it a spicy, adventurous flavor that sets it apart from more traditional major or minor scales.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- **C** (Root)\n- **D** (Major 2nd)\n- **E** (Major 3rd)\n- **F#** (Augmented 4th or #11)\n- **G** (Perfect 5th)\n- **A** (Major 6th)\n- **Bb** (Minor 7th)\n\n## Musical Flavor\nThe Melodic scale in C provides a blend of tension and release, incorporating elements of both the Lydian and Mixolydian modes.

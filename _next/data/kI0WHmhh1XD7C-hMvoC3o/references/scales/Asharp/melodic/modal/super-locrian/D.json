It is built on the seventh degree of the B# major scale and has a unique, exotic sound due to its intervals.\n\n# Notes and Intervals\n\nThe Melodic scale in A# consists of the following notes: A# - B# - C## - D# - E# - F## - G# - A#. This scale features a flattened 2nd, 3rd, and 6th, and diminished 4th, 5th, and 7th intervals. The scale has a tritone interval between the 1st and 5th degrees, which contributes to its dissonant and unresolved quality.\n\n# Genre and Musical Flavor\n\nThe Melodic scale in A# is often used in genres such as jazz and fusion, where musicians seek to add tension and dissonance to their compositions. The scale's ambiguous and unresolved nature lends itself well to creating a sense of unease or unpredictability in music. When played over specific chords or progressions, the A# Super Locrian scale can evoke a mysterious, otherworldly, or even sinister mood.\n\n# Songs\n\nThree songs that utilize the Melodic scale in A# are:\n\n1. \"Giant Steps\" by John Coltrane: This jazz standard features complex chord changes and uses the A# Super Locrian scale in various sections of the melody and solos.\n   \n2. \"Scatterbrain\" by Jeff Beck: This instrumental rock/fusion piece showcases the Melodic scale in A# during the improvisational passages, adding a sense of tension and intensity to the music.\n   \n3. \"Emanon\" by Wayne Shorter: A modern jazz composition that incorporates the A# Super Locrian scale to create a dark and enigmatic atmosphere, reflecting the scale's unique tonal qualities."}},"__N_SSG":true}

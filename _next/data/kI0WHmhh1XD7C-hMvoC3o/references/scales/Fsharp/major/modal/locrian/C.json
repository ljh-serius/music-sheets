In the context of the Locrian mode with the shape in C, the scale starts on the note B and includes the following notes:\n\n- B (root)\n- C (major 2nd)\n- D (minor 3rd)\n- E (perfect 4th)\n- F# (perfect 5th)\n- G (minor 6th)\n- A (minor 7th)\n- B (root)\n\nThis scale has a distinct sound due to its lowered 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, and 7th degrees compared to the major scale. It is often associated with a darker, more dissonant quality and is not as commonly used as some other modes.\n\n### Genre and Musical Flavor\n\nThe Locrian mode is the seventh mode of the major scale and is considered an unstable and dissonant mode due to its diminished 5th interval. It is rarely used in tonal music but can be found in some jazz, rock, and metal compositions for its unique and tense sound. The Locrian mode is often used to create tension and suspense in music due to its unstable nature and atypical intervals.\n\n### Songs that Use the Major Scale in F# (Mode: Locrian, Shape: C)\n\n1. **\"Dance of Eternity\"** by Dream Theater - This progressive metal instrumental showcases complex time signatures and modal interchange featuring the Locrian mode in sections of the song.\n   \n2. **\"No More Tears\"** by Ozzy Osbourne - The intro riff of this song features the Locrian mode in F# adding a dark and mysterious flavor to the music.\n   \n3. **\"Suspended in Tribulation\"** by Cryptopsy - A technical death metal track that incorporates the Locrian mode in sections for its dissonant and intense sound.\n\nThese songs demonstrate how the Locrian mode in F# can be used in different genres to create unique moods and add tension to musical compositions."}},"__N_SSG":true}

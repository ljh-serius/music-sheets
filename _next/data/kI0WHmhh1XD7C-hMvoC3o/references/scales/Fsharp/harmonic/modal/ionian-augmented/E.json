When played in F#, the scale functions in the Ionian augmented mode with the E shape.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- F# (Root)\n- G# (Major 2nd)\n- A# (Major 3rd)\n- B (Perfect 4th)\n- C## (Augmented 5th)\n- E (Major 7th)\n- F# (Octave)\n\n## Musical Flavor and Usage\nThe Harmonic Scale in F# with the Ionian augmented mode and E shape has a tense and dissonant quality due to the augmented 5th interval (C##). This scale is commonly used in jazz and fusion music to create a sense of tension and add a modern, avant-garde flavor to compositions.\n\n## Songs\n1. **\"Harmonic Dreams\"** by Jazz Fusion Ensemble\n2. **\"Augmented Reality\"** by Modern Jazz Quartet\n3. **\"Dissonant Serenade\"** by Avant-garde ComposerXYZ"}},"__N_SSG":true}

When played in Locrian Mode with Shape D, it emphasizes the seventh note of the scale, B#. It has a distinctive sound due to the lowered third, fifth, sixth, and seventh notes compared to the Ionian (major scale).\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- **C# (Root)**\n- D# (Major Second)\n- E# (Minor Third)\n- F# (Perfect Fourth)\n- G# (Perfect Fifth)\n- A# (Minor Sixth)\n- **B# (Diminished Seventh)**\n\n## Musical Flavor and Genre\nThe C# Major scale in Locrian Mode with Shape D often creates a dark, dissonant, and unresolved sound due to the diminished seventh (B#). This scale is commonly used in jazz, fusion, and experimental music to create tension and add complexity to compositions.\n\n## Example Songs\n1. \"Strasbourg-St. Denis\" by Roy Hargrove\n2. \"Portraits and Dreams\" by Terje Rypdal\n3. \"Points Beyond\" by Tigran Hamasyan"}},"__N_SSG":true}

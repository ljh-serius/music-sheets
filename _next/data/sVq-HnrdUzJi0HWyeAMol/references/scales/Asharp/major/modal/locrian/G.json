When played in the key of A#, this scale is derived from the A# major scale but starts on the seventh degree, making it the Locrian mode. The Locrian mode has a unique sound due to its flat second, flat fifth, and flat third intervals compared to the major scale.\n\n## Notes and Intervals:\n- A# (1)\n- B# (2)\n- C# (3)\n- D# (4)\n- E# (5)\n- F# (6)\n- G# (b7)\n\nThe intervals between the notes in the A# Locrian mode are as follows: whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, and whole step.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor:\nThe Locrian mode, derived from the Major scale, is considered one of the most dissonant and unstable modes due to the diminished fifth interval between the first and fifth degrees. This scale is rarely used in tonal music as it doesn't create a strong sense of resolution. It is often employed in jazz fusion, experimental, and avant-garde music to create tension and ambiguity in compositions.\n\n## Songs:\n1. \"Fracture\" by King Crimson\n2. \"So What\" by Miles Davis\n3. \"Red\" by John Stevens"}},"__N_SSG":true}

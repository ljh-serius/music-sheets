When played in the Locrian mode and starting on the note C, it creates a unique and dark sound due to the flattened 5th and flattened 2nd scale degrees.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- C (Root)\n- D (Major 2nd)\n- Eb (Minor 3rd)\n- F (Perfect 4th)\n- Gb (Diminished 5th)\n- Ab (Minor 6th)\n- Bb (Minor 7th)\n\n## Musical Flavor\nThe Locrian mode is the darkest and most dissonant of the diatonic modes. Due to the flattened 5th, it creates a diminished triad on the tonic, which contributes to its unsettling and unresolved quality. It is not commonly used in tonal music due to its unstable nature.\n\n## Genre and Usage\nThe Locrian mode is rarely used in its traditional form in popular music due to its dissonant and unresolved sound. However, elements of the Locrian mode can be found in certain heavy metal, jazz, and experimental music where musicians explore dissonance and tension in their compositions.\n\n## Songs\n1. **Metallica - \"Wherever I May Roam\"**: The intro riff of this song features the Locrian mode, adding a dark and mysterious vibe to the track.\n2. **Tool - \"Ticks & Leeches\"**: This song incorporates sections with Locrian elements, contributing to its intense and aggressive sound.\n3. **John Coltrane - \"Giant Steps\"**: While not purely in Locrian mode, this jazz standard features harmonic movement reminiscent of Locrian tonalities, showcasing its use in a complex jazz context."}},"__N_SSG":true}

The Melodic Minor scale differs from the more commonly used Natural Minor scale in that it features a raised sixth and seventh degree when ascending, while reverting to the Natural Minor scale when descending. This scale creates a distinctive sound that is both dark and exotic, allowing for melodically rich improvisations and compositions.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\nThe Melodic Minor scale in E consists of the following notes:\n- E (Root)\n- F#\n- G\n- A\n- B\n- C#\n- D#\n\nThe intervals for the Melodic Minor scale in E are:\n- Root (E)\n- Major 2nd (F#)\n- Minor 3rd (G)\n- Perfect 4th (A)\n- Perfect 5th (B)\n- Major 6th (C#)\n- Major 7th (D#)\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe Melodic Minor scale is often used in jazz, fusion, and classical music genres.

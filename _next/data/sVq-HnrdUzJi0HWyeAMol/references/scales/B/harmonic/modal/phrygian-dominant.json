This alteration gives it its unique sound and character.\n\n### Notes and Intervals\n- B (root)\n- C (minor second)\n- D# (major third)\n- E (perfect fourth)\n- F# (perfect fifth)\n- G (minor sixth)\n- A (minor seventh)\n\n### Genre and Flavor\nThe Harmonic in B scale is often used in music genres like Flamenco, Middle Eastern, and some styles of jazz and metal. It has an exotic and mystical flavor due to the clash between the minor second and major third intervals, creating tension and a sense of unease that can be emotionally powerful in compositions.\n\n### Songs\n1. **\"Miserlou\" by Dick Dale** - This surf rock classic uses the Phrygian dominant scale to create a hypnotic and intense feel.\n2. **\"Oriental Melody\" by Yngwie Malmsteen** - A neoclassical metal piece that showcases the scale's expressive and adventurous qualities.\n3. **\"Vicarious\" by Tool** - This progressive metal track features sections with the Phrygian dominant scale, adding depth and complexity to the music."}},"__N_SSG":true}

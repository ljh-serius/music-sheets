In this specific case, it's being played in the Locrian mode, which is the 7th mode of the Major scale. This scale brings a unique flavor due to its distance pattern of half and whole steps, which create a distinctly different mood compared to the more common major and minor scales.\n\n## Notes and Intervals:\n\n- G# (Root)\n- A# (Major 2nd)\n- B# (Major 3rd)\n- C# (Perfect 4th)\n- D# (Perfect 5th)\n- E# (Major 6th)\n- F# (Major 7th)\n- G# (Octave)\n\nThe intervals of the G# Major scale (Locrian mode) are as follows:\n- Root (G#)\n- Minor 2nd (A#)\n- Minor 3rd (B#)\n- Perfect 4th (C#)\n- Perfect 5th (D#)\n- Minor 6th (E#)\n- Minor 7th (F#)\n- Octave (G#)\n\n## Genre and Flavor:\n\nWhile the Major scale is traditionally associated with more uplifting and happy sounds, playing it in the Locrian mode provides a darker and more dissonant feel. The Locrian mode is rarely used due to its diminished fifth interval and unstable tonality. This scale is often associated with creating tension and a feeling of unease in music compositions.\n\n## Songs Using G# Major (Locrian):\n\nThree songs where you can find the Locrian mode based on the Major scale in G#:\n1. \"YYZ\" by Rush - The bass solo by Geddy Lee in this instrumental rock piece features the use of the Locrian mode.\n2. \"Toxicity\" by System of a Down - This nu-metal hit incorporates elements of the Locrian mode in its composition.\n3. \"Black Star\" by David Bowie - This experimental song makes use of the Locrian mode to create an otherworldly atmosphere."}},"__N_SSG":true}

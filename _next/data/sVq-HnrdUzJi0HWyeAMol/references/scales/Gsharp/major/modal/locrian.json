This mode is the seventh mode of the Major scale and has a unique and somewhat dissonant sound due to its tritone interval between the root note and the diminished fifth. It is not as commonly used as other modes like Ionian (Major) or Aeolian (Natural Minor) due to its unstable and unresolved quality.\n\n### Notes and Intervals:\n1. G# (Root)\n2. A#\n3. B\n4. C#\n5. D#\n6. E\n7. F#\n8. G# (Octave)\n\nIntervals:\n- Root - Major Second: A#\n- Major Second - Minor Third: B\n- Minor Third - Perfect Fourth: C#\n- Perfect Fourth - Diminished Fifth: D#\n- Diminished Fifth - Minor Sixth: E\n- Minor Sixth - Minor Seventh: F#\n- Minor Seventh - Octave: G#\n\n### Genre and Musical Flavor:\nThe Locrian mode in the Major scale, especially in G#, is not as commonly found in popular music due to its dissonant nature. It has a dark and unresolved quality, often used to create tension and a sense of unease in compositions. It is more prevalent in avant-garde, experimental, or jazz music where musicians may seek to explore unique and unconventional tonalities.\n\n### Songs:\n1. \"Fracture\" by King Crimson - This instrumental piece by the progressive rock band King Crimson showcases the Locrian mode in a complex and intricate guitar composition.\n2. \"Estranged\" by Guns N' Roses - While primarily in the key of F# minor, this rock ballad features sections that briefly explore the Locrian mode, adding a sense of tension to the song.\n3. \"Unnatural Selection\" by Muse - This alternative rock track by Muse incorporates elements of the Locrian mode in the guitar riff, contributing to the song's edgy and unpredictable sound."}},"__N_SSG":true}

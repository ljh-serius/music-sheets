In this case, we are looking at the Major scale in G# (G sharp) played in the Lydian mode, using the C shape on the guitar. \n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- G# (root)\n- A# (major 2nd)\n- B# (major 3rd)\n- C## (augmented 4th)\n- D# (perfect 5th)\n- E# (major 6th)\n- F## (major 7th)\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe Major scale in G# played in the Lydian mode has a bright and dreamy sound due to the raised 4th note compared to the regular major scale. This scale is often used in genres that aim to create an ethereal or otherworldly atmosphere like jazz fusion, progressive rock, and some styles of electronic music. The Lydian mode brings a sense of tension and release, offering a mysterious and magical quality to the music.\n\n## Songs\n1. **\"Flying in a Blue Dream\" by Joe Satriani**: This instrumental track showcases the Lydian mode in a rock fusion setting, with soaring guitar melodies that highlight the scale's dreamy and adventurous qualities.\n   \n2. **\"So What\" by Miles Davis**: While not in G#, this jazz classic by Miles Davis features the use of the Lydian mode, particularly in the improvisational sections where the musicians explore the unique sound of the scale.\n   \n3. **\"Kashmir\" by Led Zeppelin**: Although this song is not strictly in the Lydian mode, the use of the raised 4th in the riff gives it a hint of Lydian flavor, contributing to the epic and mystical vibe of the track."}},"__N_SSG":true}

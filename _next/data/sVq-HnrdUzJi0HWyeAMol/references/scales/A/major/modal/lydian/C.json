When played in the Lydian mode, it has a unique flavor due to the raised 4th scale degree compared to the regular Major scale. In this case, the scale shape is based on the C shape on the guitar fretboard but played in the key of A.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\nThe Major scale in A follows the formula W-W-H-W-W-W-H, where W represents a whole step and H a half step. In the key of A, the scale consists of the following notes: A, B, C#, D#, E, F#, and G#. The raised 4th degree (D# in this case) gives the Lydian mode its characteristic sound.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe Major scale, especially in the Lydian mode, is often used in genres that aim to create a sense of uplift, dreaminess, or otherworldliness. It is commonly found in genres like pop, jazz, fusion, and progressive rock where musicians want to add color and brightness to their compositions. The Lydian mode, with its raised 4th degree, adds a slightly ethereal and mysterious quality to the music.\n\n## Songs\nHere are three songs that prominently feature the Major scale in A (Lydian mode, Shape: C):\n1. **\"Flying in a Blue Dream\" by Joe Satriani**: This instrumental track showcases Joe Satriani's virtuosity and skillful use of the Lydian mode in a rock/fusion context.\n2. **\"Still Got the Blues\" by Gary Moore**: While primarily a blues song, Gary Moore incorporates elements of the Major scale in A to add a melodic and uplifting flavor to the guitar solos.\n3. **\"So What\" by Miles Davis**: This iconic jazz standard features modal improvisation, including the Lydian mode, and serves as an excellent example of using the Major scale in a different musical context.\n\nThese songs offer great examples of how the Major scale in A, particularly in the Lydian mode, can be used to create diverse and engaging musical expressions across various genres."}},"__N_SSG":true}

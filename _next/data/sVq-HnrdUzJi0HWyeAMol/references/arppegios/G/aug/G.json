In this case, we are looking at an augmented arpeggio based on the G major chord shape.\n\n## Notes and Intervals:\n- G (root)\n- B (major third)\n- D# (augmented fifth)\n\n## Genres and Flavor:\nAugmented arpeggios often add tension and a sense of dissonance to the music due to the augmented fifth interval. They are commonly used in genres such as jazz, fusion, and progressive rock to create a sense of unease or to add color to the harmonic progression.\n\n## Example Songs:\n1. \"Scarified\" by Racer X (Paul Gilbert)\n2. \"The Dance of Eternity\" by Dream Theater (John Petrucci)\n3. \"Bright Size Life\" by Pat Metheny"}},"__N_SSG":true}

The 9th arpeggio in E refers to playing the \"9th\" note in E major scale, which is F#, along with the other tones of the E major chord.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- E (Root)\n- G# (3rd)\n- B (5th)\n- D# (7th)\n- F# (9th)\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThis arpeggio, with the added 9th note, gives a jazzy and sophisticated flavor to the music. It is often used in jazz, fusion, and sometimes in rock music to add color and depth to chord progressions. The 9th adds tension and color to the chord, making it sound more rich and complex.\n\n## Songs\n1. \"Little Sunflower\" by Freddie Hubbard\n2. \"So What\" by Miles Davis\n3. \"Europa\" by Carlos Santana"}},"__N_SSG":true}

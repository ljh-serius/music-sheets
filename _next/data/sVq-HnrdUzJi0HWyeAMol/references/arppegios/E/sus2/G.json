In this case, we are looking at a suspended second arpeggio in the key of E in the G shape.\n\n---\n\n### Notes and Intervals:\n\n- **E** (Root)\n- **F#** (Second)\n- **B** (Fifth)\n- **E** (Octave/Root)\n\nThe arpeggio consists of the root note E, the second note F# which creates the sus2 sound, the fifth note B, and another octave/root note E.\n\n---\n\n### Genre and Musical Flavor:\n\nThis particular arpeggio, with its suspended second, often creates a dreamy and unresolved sound. It is commonly used in various genres like rock, pop, and jazz to add color and texture to a chord progression. The sus2 arpeggio evokes a sense of mystery and tension, and can be used to create a more contemporary and ambient feel in music.\n\n---\n\n### Songs Using this Arpeggio:\n\n1. **\"Don't Fear The Reaper\" by Blue Ã–yster Cult** - The intro features a prominent sus2 arpeggio in the key of E.\n   \n2. **\"Every Breath You Take\" by The Police** - This classic song uses a sus2 arpeggio in E during the verses, adding a haunting quality to the progression.\n   \n3. **\"Black\" by Pearl Jam** - The opening arpeggio in this song uses the sus2 chord shape in the key of E, contributing to the melancholic atmosphere.\n\n---"}},"__N_SSG":true}

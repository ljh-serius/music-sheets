The 13th arpeggio in the key of D# would consist of the notes D#-F##-A#-C#-E# or, enharmonically spelled, D#-G-A#-C#-F.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n\nThe D#13 arpeggio is made up of the following intervals:\n\n- D# to F## (an augmented 2nd)\n- F## to A# (a minor 3rd)\n- A# to C# (a major 3rd)\n- C# to E# (a major 3rd)\n- E# to D# (a diminished 7th)\n\n## Genre and Flavor\n\nArpeggios, including the D#13 arpeggio, are commonly associated with various genres of music, such as classical, jazz, and progressive rock. The D#13 arpeggio, specifically, adds a rich and jazzy flavor to music due to the combination of major and minor 3rd intervals. It can create a sense of tension and resolution and is often used in sophisticated and harmonically complex compositions.\n\n## Songs\n\nThree songs that utilize the D#13 arpeggio are:\n\n1. **\"Take the 'A' Train\" by Duke Ellington:** This jazz standard features arpeggios in various keys, including the D#13 arpeggio, adding color and complexity to the chord progressions.\n  \n2. **\"Cliffs of Dover\" by Eric Johnson:** This instrumental rock piece showcases intricate arpeggios, including the D#13 arpeggio, in a high-energy setting, highlighting the arpeggio's versatility across genres.\n  \n3. **\"Prelude in E-Minor\" by Frédéric Chopin:** This classical piano piece demonstrates the emotional depth and melodic beauty that can be achieved with arpeggios, including the D#13 arpeggio, in a solo piano composition."}},"__N_SSG":true}

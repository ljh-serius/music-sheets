An arpeggio is essentially a chord played one note at a time, and the \"add2\" indicates that the second note in the scale is added to the chord. In this case, we're playing an E major shape arpeggio over a D# root note.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\nThe notes in this arpeggio would be D# (root note), F# (major third), G# (perfect fifth), and F (major second). The intervals between these notes create the unique sound of this arpeggio.\n\n- D# (Root) to F# (Major Third): This interval provides the chord its major quality.\n- D# (Root) to G# (Perfect Fifth): The perfect fifth adds stability and fullness to the chord.\n- D# (Root) to F (Major Second): The major second adds a harmonic color, distinguishing it from a traditional major triad.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nArpeggios incorporating the \"add2\" flavor are often found in contemporary pop, rock, and jazz music.

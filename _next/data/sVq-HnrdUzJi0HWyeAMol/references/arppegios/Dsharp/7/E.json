In this case, we are looking at the Dominant 7th arpeggio in the key of D# (enharmonically equivalent to Eb) with its shape based on the key of E.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\nThe Dominant 7th chord consists of four notes -- the root, major third, perfect fifth, and minor seventh. In the key of D#/Eb, the notes of the Dominant 7th chord are D# (root), Fx (major third), A# (perfect fifth), and C# (minor seventh). When played as an arpeggio in the shape of E on the guitar, these notes are sequenced in a specific pattern to create the Dominant 7th arpeggio sound.\n\n* Root (D#) - Major Third (Fx) - Perfect Fifth (A#) - Minor Seventh (C#)\n\n## Genre and Flavor\nThe Dominant 7th arpeggio is commonly used in jazz, blues, and rock music genres. It carries a bluesy and jazzy flavor, adding tension and color to chord progressions. The Dominant 7th chord is known for its strong pull to the tonic chord, creating a sense of resolution when used in a cadential context. It often adds a sense of sophistication and complexity to the music when played as an arpeggio, especially in improvisational settings.\n\n## Songs\nHere are three songs that prominently feature the Dominant 7th arpeggio in D# (Shape: E):\n\n1. **\"Sweet Home Chicago\" by Robert Johnson** - This blues standard features the Dominant 7th arpeggio prominently in its iconic riff, showcasing the arpeggio's bluesy flavor and expressive capabilities.\n\n2. **\"Autumn Leaves\" (jazz standard)** - In jazz music, the Dominant 7th arpeggio is frequently used for improvisation and melodic embellishments. \"Autumn Leaves\" is a classic jazz tune that incorporates the Dominant 7th arpeggio in various chord progressions throughout the song.\n\n3. **\"Rock and Roll\" by Led Zeppelin** - Led Zeppelin often incorporated blues elements into their rock music.

They are broken chords where the notes are played successively, instead of simultaneously. The 13th arpeggio in the key of A, based on the G shape, includes the root note (A), major third (C#), perfect fifth (E), dominant seventh (G), and thirteenth (F#).\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- A (Root)\n- C# (Major Third)\n- E (Perfect Fifth)\n- G (Dominant Seventh)\n- F# (Thirteenth)\n\n## Genre Usage\nThis arpeggio, with its jazzy and colorful extended qualities, is often used in genres like jazz, fusion, and R&B. It can add a sophisticated and rich harmonic texture, particularly in improvisations, chord progressions, and transitions in these styles.\n\n## Musical Flavor\nThe 13th arpeggio in A, based on the G shape, provides a lush and complex sound due to the inclusion of the thirteenth interval. It conveys a sense of tension and release, adding depth and harmonic interest to compositions, solos, and arrangements.\n\n## Songs\n- \"So What\" by Miles Davis\n- \"Isn't She Lovely\" by Stevie Wonder\n- \"Cantaloupe Island\" by Herbie Hancock"}},"__N_SSG":true}

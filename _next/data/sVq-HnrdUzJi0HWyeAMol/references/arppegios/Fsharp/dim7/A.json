The Diminished 7th chord is made up of a root note, a minor third, a diminished fifth, and a diminished seventh above the root. When played as an arpeggio in the key of F# in shape A, the notes would be F# (root), A (minor third), C (diminished fifth), and E♭ (diminished seventh).\n\n## Notes:\n- F# (Root)\n- A (Minor Third)\n- C (Diminished Fifth)\n- E♭ (Diminished Seventh)\n\n## Genre and Flavor:\nThe Diminished 7th arpeggio is commonly used in jazz, classical, and some progressive rock music. It adds tension and dissonance to a piece, creating a unique and mysterious flavor.\n\n## Three Songs:\n1. \"Caravan\" by Duke Ellington \n2. \"Clair de Lune\" by Claude Debussy\n3. \"Pull Me Under\" by Dream Theater"}},"__N_SSG":true}

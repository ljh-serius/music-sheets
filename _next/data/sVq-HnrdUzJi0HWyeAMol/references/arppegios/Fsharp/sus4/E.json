The suspended 4th note replaces the 3rd degree of the chord, adding tension and ambiguity to the tonality.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- Root (`F#`)\n- 4th (`B`)\n- 5th (`C#`)\n\nThese notes create a dreamy and unresolved atmosphere due to the absence of the major 3rd, typical in major or minor chords.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThis arpeggio, with its suspended 4th, is often used in genres like progressive rock, jazz fusion, and experimental music. It introduces a sense of intrigue and modernity to compositions, providing a departure from more traditional harmonic structures.\n\n## Songs\nHere are three songs that feature the `sus4` arpeggio in `F#` played in the shape of `E`:\n1. \"The Dance of Eternity\" by Dream Theater\n2. \"Resolution\" by John Coltrane\n3. \"Pyramid Song\" by Radiohead\n\nThese songs showcase the versatility and emotive qualities of this arpeggio in different musical contexts."}},"__N_SSG":true}

In the case of the add2 arpeggio in the key of F, it involves playing the F major chord (F-A-C) with the addition of the G note, which is the 2nd degree in the key of F.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- F (Root)\n- G (Major 2nd)\n- A (Perfect 4th)\n- C (Perfect 5th)\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe add2 arpeggio in F can be used in various genres, particularly in jazz, pop, and classical music. The added 2nd (G note) gives the arpeggio a dreamy and ethereal quality, often used to create a sense of suspension and tension in a piece of music.\n\n## Songs\nHere are three songs that feature the add2 arpeggio in the key of F:\n1. **\"Don't Know Why\" by Norah Jones**: This popular jazz-pop ballad features the F add2 arpeggio in its chord progressions.\n2. **\"Clair de Lune\" by Claude Debussy**: This classical piano piece showcases the delicate and evocative use of the F add2 arpeggio.\n3. **\"Pure Shores\" by All Saints**: This atmospheric pop song integrates the F add2 arpeggio to create a soothing and introspective mood."}},"__N_SSG":true}

The \"add4\" chord extension includes the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 4th notes of the scale. In this case, we will explore an Add4 arpeggio in the key of F, utilizing a C-shaped fingering pattern on the guitar. \n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- **F (Root)**: This is the starting note and the tonic of the F major chord.\n- **A (Major 3rd)**: The third note in the F major scale, which gives the chord its major quality.\n- **C (Perfect 5th)**: The fifth note in the F major scale, providing stability to the chord.\n- **Bb (Add4)**: This is the added 4th note, which gives the arpeggio its distinctive flavor.\n\nWhen played as an arpeggio in the C shape on the guitar, the F add4 chord produces a dreamy and slightly dissonant sound due to the tension created by the added 4th note.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe F add4 arpeggio in the C shape is often found in genres like jazz, fusion, and experimental music.

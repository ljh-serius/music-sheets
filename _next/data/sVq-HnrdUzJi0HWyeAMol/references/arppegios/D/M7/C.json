The Major 7th arpeggio is built from the root, major 3rd, perfect 5th, and major 7th of the corresponding major scale. When played, it imparts a sense of sophistication and jazzy feel to a musical passage.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n\nIn the key of D, the D Major 7th arpeggio consists of the notes D (root), F# (major 3rd), A (perfect 5th), and C# (major 7th). The intervals between these notes create a lush and harmonically rich sound that is commonly associated with jazz and some forms of fusion music.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\n\nThe Major 7th arpeggio is often used in jazz, bossa nova, and other sophisticated styles of music. It adds a sense of elegance and complexity to a composition, making it sound more refined and harmonically colorful. Musicians use this arpeggio to create smooth and flowing melodic lines that convey a sense of warmth and sophistication.\n\n## Songs\n1. \"So What\" by Miles Davis\n2. \"The Girl From Ipanema\" by Antonio Carlos Jobim\n3. \"Cantaloupe Island\" by Herbie Hancock"}},"__N_SSG":true}

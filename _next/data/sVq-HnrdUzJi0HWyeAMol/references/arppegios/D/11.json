In music theory, the 11th in a chord refers to the note that is an eleventh above the root. In this case, we are looking at the D arpeggio with the added eleventh note, often played as part of a D major or Dmaj7 chord.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\nThe D major arpeggio consists of the notes D-F#-A-D, with the added eleventh note being G. The intervals are as follows:\n- Root (D)\n- Major Third (F#)\n- Perfect Fifth (A)\n- Root (D)\n- Perfect Eleven (G)\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe arpeggio with the added eleventh note in D is commonly used in jazz music, giving a dreamy and ethereal quality to the sound. It adds color and tension to the chord, creating a lush and rich harmonic texture. This arpeggio can be found in smooth jazz, fusion, and other sub-genres where complex harmonies are appreciated.\n\n## Songs\nHere are three songs that use the D arpeggio with the eleventh note:\n1. **\"Cantaloupe Island\" by Herbie Hancock** - Features a Dmaj7 chord arpeggio in the famous piano riff.\n2. **\"Chameleon\" by Herbie Hancock** - Contains sections where the Dmaj7 arpeggio with the eleventh is featured prominently.\n3. **\"Spain\" by Chick Corea and Return to Forever** - Utilizes complex chord progressions that highlight the D arpeggio with the added eleventh for a sophisticated sound."}},"__N_SSG":true}

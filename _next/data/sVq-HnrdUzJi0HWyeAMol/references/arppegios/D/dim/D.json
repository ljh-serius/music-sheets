The Diminished arpeggio is a type of arpeggio that consists of three notes: the root, the minor third, and the diminished fifth. In the key of D, the Diminished arpeggio would include the notes D, F, and Ab.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- Root (D)\n- Minor Third (F)\n- Diminished Fifth (Ab)\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe Diminished arpeggio is often used in genres such as jazz, classical, and metal.

A sus2 chord is a type of suspended chord that replaces the third with the second degree of the scale. In this case, we will explore an arpeggio based on the sus2 sonority in the key of D major. \n\n## Notes and Intervals\nIn a D major sus2 arpeggio, the notes used would be D (root), E (2nd), A (5th), and possibly octave D notes. The intervals in this arpeggio would be a major 2nd (D-E) and a perfect 4th (D-A), giving it a dreamy and suspended sound.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nArpeggios featuring sus2 chords in the key of D are often found in genres like folk, pop, and new age music.

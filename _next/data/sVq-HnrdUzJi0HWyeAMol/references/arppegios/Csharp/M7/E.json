In this case, the Major 7th arpeggio in C# has the shape of an E chord on the guitar. It consists of the notes C#, E#, G#, and B# (enharmonically equivalent to C#, F, G#, and C).\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- **C# (Root)**: The first note of the arpeggio, establishing the C# major quality.\n- **E# (Major 3rd)**: The second note, which creates the major tonality of the chord.\n- **G# (Perfect 5th)**: The third note, contributing to the stability and consonance of the arpeggio.\n- **B# (Major 7th)**: The final note, adding color and tension as the major 7th interval in the chord.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe Major 7th arpeggio in C# (E shape) is commonly found in genres like jazz, fusion, and R&B.

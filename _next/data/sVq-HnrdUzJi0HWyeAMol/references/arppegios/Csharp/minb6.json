In this case, the arpeggio is based on the C# minor chord with an added flat 6th (A).\n\n## Notes and Intervals:\n\n- C# (root)\n- E (minor third)\n- G# (perfect fifth)\n- A (minor 6th)\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor:\n\nThe minor b6th arpeggio creates a melancholic and mysterious sound due to the dissonant nature of the minor 6th interval. This arpeggio is commonly used in various genres such as jazz, blues, and metal music to add tension and color to chord progressions and solos.\n\n## Example Songs:\n\n1. **\"Purple Haze\" by Jimi Hendrix**: This iconic guitar riff in the intro of the song features the C# minor b6th arpeggio.\n2. **\"So What\" by Miles Davis**: In this jazz standard, you can hear the minor b6th arpeggio used in various improvisational sections.\n3. **\"Floods\" by Pantera**: The guitar solo in this metal song showcases the C# minor b6th arpeggio in a heavy context."}},"__N_SSG":true}

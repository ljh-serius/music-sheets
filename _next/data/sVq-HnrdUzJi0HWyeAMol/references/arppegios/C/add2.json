An \"add2\" chord means you take a basic triad (root, third, and fifth) and add the second note of the scale to it. \n\nIn the key of C major, the notes are as follows:\n\n- C (Root)\n- D (2nd)\n- E (3rd)\n- G (5th)\n\nTherefore, a C add2 arpeggio would consist of the notes C, D, E, and G being played in succession.\n\n## Musical Flavor and Genre\n\nThe added second to the arpeggio creates a dreamy and ethereal sound. It adds a sense of tension and color to the chord. The C add2 arpeggio is often heard in genres such as ambient music, ballads, and soft rock. It can evoke feelings of introspection and nostalgia in the listener.\n\n## Songs\n\n1. **\"Wonderful Tonight\" by Eric Clapton**\n   - This classic ballad features the use of add2 arpeggios in the guitar accompaniment, adding a romantic and emotive quality to the music.\n\n2. **\"Don't Know Why\" by Norah Jones**\n   - The opening piano chords in this jazz-influenced song utilize add2 arpeggios, setting a mellow and sophisticated tone for the rest of the track.\n\n3. **\"Breathe\" by Pink Floyd**\n   - In this iconic song, the gentle guitar arpeggios in the intro and interludes showcase the haunting beauty of the add2 arpeggio, enhancing the atmospheric and contemplative nature of the music."}},"__N_SSG":true}

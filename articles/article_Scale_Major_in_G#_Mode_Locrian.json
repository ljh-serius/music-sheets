This mode is the seventh mode of the Major scale and has a unique and somewhat dissonant sound due to its tritone interval between the root note and the diminished fifth. It is not as commonly used as other modes like Ionian (Major) or Aeolian (Natural Minor) due to its unstable and unresolved quality.\n\n### Notes and Intervals:\n1. G# (Root)\n2. A#\n3. B\n4. C#\n5.

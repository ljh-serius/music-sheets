The shape presented here is based on the C major scale but starting on the root note F to create the Minor 7b5 arpeggio in the key of F.\n\n### Notes and Intervals\n- Root (F)\n- Minor 3rd (Ab)\n- Diminished 5th (C)\n- Minor 7th (Eb)\n\n### Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe Minor 7b5 arpeggio is commonly used in jazz, fusion, and some forms of classical music. This arpeggio creates a mysterious and slightly dissonant sound due to the presence of the diminished fifth interval. It adds tension and a complex, jazzy flavor to compositions when played over minor chords or as a passing tone in improvisation.\n\n### Songs\nHere are three songs where you can hear the Minor 7b5 arpeggio being utilized effectively:\n1. **\"Autumn Leaves\"** by Joseph Kosma\n2. **\"Blue Bossa\"** by Kenny Dorham\n3. **\"Nardis\"** by Miles Davis"}

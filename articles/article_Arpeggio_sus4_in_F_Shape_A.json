In this case, the arpeggio consists of the 1st (root), 4th, and 5th notes of an F Major chord, which creates an F sus4 sound. The shape used here is based on an A major chord shape.\n\n### Notes and Intervals\n- F (root)\n- Bb (4th)\n- C (5th)\n\n### Genre and Musical Flavor\nThis arpeggio creates a dreamy, suspended sound due to the sus4 quality.

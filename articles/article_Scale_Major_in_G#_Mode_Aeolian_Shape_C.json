{"title":"Scale: Major in G# (Mode: Aeolian, Shape: C)","content":"# Scale: Major in G# (Mode: Aeolian, Shape: C)\n\n## Brief Presentation\nThe Major scale in G# is a heptatonic scale, also known as the Ionian mode, starting on the note G#. In the context of the Aeolian mode, which is the natural minor scale having the same notes as the Major scale but starting from the 6th degree, the G# Major scale carries the flavor of a melancholic and darker tone due to its relationship with the minor scale. The Major scale is one of the most fundamental and widely used scales in Western music.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- G# (I)\n- A# (II)\n- B# (III)\n- C# (IV)\n- D# (V)\n- E# (VI)\n- F## (VII)\n\nThe intervals for the G# Major scale are as follows:\n- Major 2nd (A#)\n- Major 3rd (B#)\n- Perfect 4th (C#)\n- Perfect 5th (D#)\n- Major 6th (E#)\n- Major 7th (F##)\n\n## Genre and Flavor\nThe Major scale in G# is often used in various genres of music, including pop, rock, jazz, and classical.

{"title":"Arpeggio: sus4 in C","content":"# Arpeggio: sus4 in C\n\n## Brief Presentation\nAn arpeggio is the playing of the individual notes of a chord in a sequential order rather than simultaneously. In this case, we will focus on the suspended fourth (sus4) arpeggio in the key of C major. The sus4 arpeggio introduces a tension-filled but resolved sound due to the presence of the fourth instead of the third in the chord.\n\n## Notes and Intervals\nThe C major chord consists of the notes C, E, and G. In a sus4 chord, the third, E, is replaced by the fourth, F. Therefore, the C sus4 arpeggio in C major consists of the notes C (root), F (fourth), and G (fifth). The intervals between these notes are a perfect fourth between C and F, and a major second between F and G.\n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThe sus4 arpeggio is often used in various genres including rock, folk, and jazz. This arpeggio adds a sense of tension and intrigue to the music due to the suspension of the fourth interval. It creates a distinctive sound that can evoke emotions ranging from uncertainty to resolution, offering a unique flavor to the music.\n\n## Songs\n1. **\"Stairway to Heaven\" by Led Zeppelin**: The iconic intro of \"Stairway to Heaven\" features a sus4 arpeggio, showcasing its evocative and melodic qualities.\n   \n2. **\"Dear Prudence\" by The Beatles**: The arpeggiated guitar riff in the song \"Dear Prudence\" uses the sus4 chord to create a dreamy and atmospheric sound.\n    \n3. **\"Scar Tissue\" by Red Hot Chili Peppers**: The introduction of \"Scar Tissue\" incorporates a sus4 arpeggio, contributing to the melancholic and introspective vibe of the song."}

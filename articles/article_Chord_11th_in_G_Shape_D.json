{"title":"Chord: 11th in G (Shape: D)","content":"# Chord: 11th in G (Shape: D)\n\nThe 11th chord in G played using the D shape on the guitar is a rich and colorful chord voicing that adds depth and complexity to a progression in the key of G. This chord shape features the following notes: G (root), D (5th), F# (7th), A (9th), and C (11th). \n\n## Notes and Intervals\n- G (Root)\n- A (9th)\n- B (10th missing in this voicing)\n- C (11th)\n- D (5th)\n- F# (7th)\n\nThe absence of the 3rd in this voicing gives the chord a \"suspended\" quality, and the addition of the 9th and 11th creates a lush and jazzy sound that can add a sense of tension and resolution to a progression. \n\n## Genre and Musical Flavor\nThis voicing is commonly used in jazz, fusion, and other sophisticated styles of music. It adds a more complex and colorful flavor compared to traditional triads and seventh chords. The 11th chord in G (played using the D shape) can create a dreamy, ethereal atmosphere when used in the right context.\n\n## Example Songs\n1. \"So What\" by Miles Davis\n2. \"Maiden Voyage\" by Herbie Hancock\n3. \"Spain\" by Chick Corea"}
